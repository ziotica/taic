RO-2008-106,"Report 09-103: Passenger Train 1608, collision with slip and derailment, Tunnel 1, Wairarapa Line, Maymorn, 23 July 2009 (incorporating investigation 08-106, collision with slip and derailment on the Johnsonville Line)
",23 Jul 2008,28 Oct 2010,08-106,"On the evening of Thursday 23 July 2009, the Wellington region was experiencing a storm that brought heavy rain and strong winds. At 1817, a scheduled commuter train travelling from Wellington to Masterton with approximately 240 passengers and crew in 5 carriages, collided with a slip that partially blocked the northern portal of Tunnel 1 on the Wairarapa Line. This point was about 4 km north of Upper Hutt station and about 1 km before the Maymorn station. The locomotive and generator carriage were embedded in the slip and derailed, while the remaining carriages were still on the track but standing within the tunnel. Emergency services were called to rescue the passengers and crew. The damage to the train was minimal and no injuries were reported. The Wairarapa Line was closed for approximately 5 days while the mud was cleared and the track repaired. Police assumed management of the accident’s rescue phase using the New Zealand Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) and activated a full tunnel response. The locomotive from a following Masterton-bound passenger train was used to haul the rear 3 carriages from the disabled train back to Upper Hutt with all passengers on board. The landslide had occurred suddenly, less than one hour before the train collided with it. It had partially blocked the northern end of Tunnel 1. The landslide was a first-time occurrence on a risk-prone slope that was covered in regenerating bush. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission determined that the landslide occurred from natural causes after 62 millimetres (mm) of rainfall fell in the area during a 6-hour period. Train 1608 had been travelling at normal speed when the driver saw the landslide, but he had had insufficient clear distance ahead to stop the train before impact. Network control had not warned the driver that the Wairarapa Line was subject to both ‘heavy rain’ and ‘strong wind’ warnings at the time. Network control had received an updated severe weather warning message to the active severe weather event 24 hours before the accident, but network control had not distributed this message and several following messages to area managers. Even if it had, the area manager for the Maymorn area would not have received them because he was new to the job and his contact details had not been recorded in the system. The track inspection regime was based upon checking specific items along the track, so was not capable of assessing the potential risk of slope failures, although this type of risk was common in the Wellington area and documented in a railway structures guidance manual. The severe weather warnings and track inspection systems, if followed, could have mitigated the consequences of a slip falling across the track but would not necessarily have prevented trains running into it. The passengers were kept in the carriages within the tunnel for some 3 hours. Improvements in the communications around the emergency response and rail recovery operations could have reduced this time by up to 30 minutes, but the recovery was safely coordinated and resulted in no injuries to the passengers and crew. The location of the derailment and the general disruption to transport services throughout the region due to the severe weather meant the response to this event was reasonable. Four safety recommendations have been made to the NZ Transport Agency to address issues around the track inspection process, the severe weather warning system and the National Rail System Standard (NRSS) for incident response. During the course of this inquiry, KiwiRail initiated several safety actions that were directly relevant to the Commission's findings. The safety actions are described in section 6 of this report and include the development of a slope hazard risk assessment for the rail network, improvements to the train control facilities and changes to the failure mode of the internal 'S' Car pneumatically operated passenger doors.",NA,Wadestown
RO-2008-107,"Report 08-102: Metro passenger train derailment, Sylvia Park, 14 April 2008 (incorporating inquiries 08-104 and 08-107) Diesel motor fires on board metro passenger trains, 3 June 2008 and 25 July 2008
",25 Jul 2008,29 Sep 2011,08-107,"On Monday 14 April 2008, a brake pad calliper fell from a wheel set on the fourth car of a DMU passenger train at Sylvia Park. The brake calliper fell across the rail and derailed one wheel set on the train. The train was stopped, but not before the wheel set, plus another that subsequently derailed, had re-railed. The brake calliper fell because the securing key had either failed or worked loose. Damage to the train was minimal and no-one was injured. On Tuesday 3 June 2008, and again on Friday 25 July 2008, fires broke out in the area of the diesel auxiliary motors fitted on DMU passenger trains while running scheduled services at Glen Eden and Waitakere respectively. On each occasion the train was stopped and the fire extinguished by the train crews with assistance from the New Zealand Fire Service in one incident, with minimal damage to the train and no persons injured. Both fires were seated on the top of the under-slung auxiliary motors. The Commission had investigated 3 previous auxiliary motor fire incidents since 2004 and found that cleanliness was an issue in all 3 incidents because oily residue that had accumulated on top of the motors had been ignited. The cause of all 3 incidents in this report stemmed from inadequate service and maintenance practices at the Auckland passenger vehicle maintenance depot located at Westfield (the maintenance depot). The maintenance depot was not delivering a maintenance regime that was in line with sound railway engineering practices, and although the maintenance depot had to cope with more and longer trains than those for which it had originally been designed for, it might have delivered a better level of maintenance if better systems had been in place. According to the Railways Act 2005 and rail participants’ safety cases, KiwiRail was responsible for maintaining the Auckland metro trains and the operator Veolia was responsible for monitoring KiwiRail’s performance to ensure that the trains were being maintained in accordance with sound railway engineering practices. The contractual arrangements between ARTA (the owner of the trains), Veolia (the operator of the trains) and KiwiRail (the maintainer of the trains) were consistent with the Railways Act 2005 and the National Rail System Standard (NRSS). A blurring of responsibilities around the contracts and a breakdown of relationships at that time at a senior management level in all 3 entities were hampering the effective execution of those contracts. Insufficient investment had been put into expanding and improving the efficiency of the then current maintenance facility at Westfield to cope with the planned increase in passenger rolling stock. KiwiRail has taken safety actions to address the specific maintenance issues contributing to the 3 incidents, and has also made significant modifications to the maintenance depot to improve its efficiency and level of safety. ARTA and KiwiRail have also allocated some stabling and servicing of the Auckland metro trains to other facilities around Auckland to alleviate the demands placed on the maintenance depot at Westfield. In view of the safety actions taken, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) has made no new safety recommendations. Key lessons: Oily residue or other combustible material that is allowed to accumulate on or around combustion motors is a fire hazard. Sound railway engineering practice and procedures are essential for safe and reliable rail rolling stock. Rail maintenance facilities should be designed and maintained for the purpose for which they were being used. Planning for future rail systems should include all aspects of the rail system, including how rolling stock was going to be maintained.",NA,Waitakere
RO-2008-108,"Express freight Train 845, track warrant overrun, Reefton - Cronadun, 13 August 2008
",13 Aug 2008,10 Dec 2009,08-108,"On Wednesday, 13 August 2008 at 0941, express freight Train 845, a westbound Lyttelton to Ngakawau empty coal service, overran its track warrant limit at Reefton. The locomotive engineer continued to drive the train for a further 8.75 kilometres before he realised what had happened and stopped the train. There were no conflicting movements or track engineering occupations. Two employees of the operator had been authorised to ride in the cab and were travelling with the locomotive engineer at the time to familiarise themselves with coal route operations. The investigation has determined that onboard discussion most likely distracted the locomotive engineer, meaning that he forgot the limit of his track warrant as it approached and passed. While the cab pass holders were properly authorised and the passes carried contained appropriate warnings, the locomotive engineer was the only person available to give the information they needed to fulfil the purpose of their trip, which left him vulnerable to distraction. The operator has revised its procedures following its own investigation into this incident. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) concluded that in spite of existing defences in the track warrant control system to prevent overruns, the system was still vulnerable to the weakest link, limitations of human performance. Previous safety recommendations the Commission has made about using advances in technology to mitigate the risk of track warrant overruns are equally applicable to this report.",NA,Reefton
RO-2008-109,"Passenger express Train 9113, platform overrun resulting in signal passed at danger, Fruitvale Road Station, North Auckland Line, 4 September 2008
",4 Sep 2008,23 Dec 2010,08-109,"On Thursday 4 September 2008 at about 0827, push/pull commuter passenger Train 9113, travelling on the Down Main North Auckland line from Waitakere to Britomart, overran Fruitvale Road Station platform. The train was travelling at 36 kilometres per hour (km/h) when it passed the end of the platform and had slowed to 31 km/h when it passed Stop and Proceed Signal 2097 displaying a Stop indication. The train was still travelling at 29 km/h when it entered Fruitvale Road level crossing, 38 metres (m) past the end of the platform and 27 m past Signal 2097. The train stopped with the rear door of the fourth carriage alongside the station platform. All doors on the platform side of the train were opened and alighting passengers were allowed to step down onto the track formation and the level crossing. The train continued on towards Britomart after those passengers waiting at the platform had boarded through the rear passenger car. Trains approaching Fruitvale Road Station on the Down Main line were restricted to a maximum speed of 65 km/h because of the track alignment. Therefore, the non-stopping approach distance for trains was 436 m from the Fruitvale Road kerb line to provide motorists with 24 seconds’ warning time on the flashing lights and bells and barrier arms protecting the level crossing. Because nearly all trains travelling on the Down Main line stopped at Fruitvale Road Station, a ""vital timer"" delay was set at 30 seconds to delay the activation of the flashing lights and bells. This time delay was built into the level crossing control system to minimise the waiting time for motorists while the train was stopped at the station for passenger work. The barrier arms at Fruitvale Road level crossing were fully extended into the horizontal position just as Train 9113 passed Signal 2097. The level crossing protection had been activated by Train 8110, approaching Fruitvale Road on the parallel Up Main line. Had Train 8110 entered Fruitvale Road level crossing more than 12 seconds later than it did, Train 9113 would have entered the level crossing with the flashing lights and bells having only been operating for 1.3 seconds and the barrier arms would still have been in the vertical position. The Commission has made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to conduct a risk assessment of the level crossing control system at those locations where station platforms are located between level crossings and the start of level crossing approach track circuits. The platform overrun at Fruitvale Road Station was similar to other events investigated in Commission report 07-105. At the time of the overrun at Fruitvale Road Station, KiwiRail had not trained locomotive engineers in a ""best practice"" train handling technique for stopping push/pull passenger trains fitted with graduated release brakes. The Commission would have made such a recommendation had KiwiRail not developed an operating instruction and started retraining locomotive engineers.\",044/10,Fruitvale
RO-2008-110,"Train control operating irregularity, leading to potential low-speed, head-on collision, Amokura, 23 September 2008",23 Sep 2008,5 Aug 2010,08-110,"A train controller starting his morning shift on 23 September 2008 unknowingly planned to direct a freight train along a line that was occupied by another freight train, which was standing awaiting routing through an area where a signalling fault was under repair. He was not aware the second train was stationary on the line. A potential low-speed, head-on collision was avoided when the first train was subsequently routed along the adjacent line after the signal failure had been partially corrected. The existence of the second train was not known to the train controller because the senior controller in charge of the previous shift had omitted to record the movement of the train on the train control diagram, and it was not showing on the mimic screen in the national train control centre owing to the signal failure. Neither the current train controller, nor the previous controller and a trainee controller he was mentoring had noticed that the second train, which was a scheduled service, was not displayed on the train control system. The train controller who omitted to record the second train on the train control diagram was suffering from fatigue caused by an excessive planned and unplanned work roster that offered limited opportunity to sleep, in spite of his working hours closely conforming to the minimum requirements of the network service provider. Investigations into previous train control incidents have led to recommendations about the potential use of existing onboard train technology to give train control live tracking of train locations, which could have helped avoid this incident by showing the existence of the second train in spite of the signalling failure. KiwiRail management has introduced a new fatigue policy since the incident, and it has previously responded to fatigue related recommendations resulting from investigations into previous incidents. Since this incident the Transport Accident Investigation Commission has made 3 new recommendations to the rail regulator concerning train controller rostering, shift handover procedures and the retraining of train controllers after extended breaks from operating critical systems.","017/10, 018/10, 019/10",Amokura

",3 Oct 2008,4 Aug 2011,08-111,"On Saturday 3 October 2008, the second-to-last wagon on express freight Train 524, wagon UK9007, conveying 2 loaded liquid petroleum gas (LPG) tanks, derailed between Puketutu and Te Kuiti on the NIMT while travelling around a 260-metre (m) radius right-hand curve at the posted line speed of 60 kilometres per hour (km/h). The locomotive engineer stopped the train after hearing an automated voice alert from a dragging equipment detector, located about 500 m past the point of derailment (POD). The derailed wagon remained upright and connected to the train. None of the other 27 wagons on the train derailed. The LPG tanks were examined and certified as safe by Fire Service personnel and a representative of the consignee before recovery work got underway. The cause of the derailment was attributed to a combination of the wagon condition and track condition. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) has made previous safety recommendations to the regulator to adjust the allowable track and wagon maintenance tolerances to reduce the potential for derailments caused by dynamic interaction. The Commission has made one new safety recommendation in this report relating to the way with which temporary speed restrictions are set when multiple track geometry faults within a common section of track are identified.",018/11,Puketutu

RO-2009-101,"(incorporating 08-105): express freight train derailments owing to the failure of bogie side frames, various locations on the North Island Main Trunk, between 21 June 2008 and 7 May 2009
",7 May 2009,21 Oct 2010,09-101,"Between 21 June 2008 and 7 May 2009, 3 express freight trains derailed at various locations on the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) line. All 3 derailments were caused by the failure and collapse of bogie side frames on wagons. The side frame failures were all similar in that they started with a fatigue crack that propagated over a period of days rather than weeks, through the box section of the side frame, until the remaining material failed in overload during normal train operations. The side frame failures were also similar to previous side frame failures investigated and reported on by the Commission. The cracks started in an area that would have been difficult to detect during normal operational and maintenance wagon checks. The side frames sometimes lacked identifying marks and historically there had been no records kept of their age and maintenance history, so the operator had started a programme of magnetic particle inspections (MPIs) to detect the presence of fatigue cracking in the side frames when the bogies were brought in for overhaul. The inspection programme found over 4 years an average 60% of side frames with cracks that required repair. At the current inspection rate, all side frames will not be inspected before 2020. Until all side frames are tested for cracks and repaired, the potential for main-line derailments attributed to bogie side frame failures remains. Given the risk that main-line derailments pose to people and infrastructure, the Commission has made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to conduct a risk assessment and if necessary require the inspection rate of side frames to be accelerated.",043/10,Hunterville
RO-2009-102,"Passenger fatality after falling between platform and passenger Train 8125, Newmarket West station, 1 July 2009
",1 Jul 2009,10 Mar 2011,09-102,"On Wednesday 1 July 2009, an elderly male passenger who was vision-impaired had just alighted from passenger Train 8125 on the Down platform at Newmarket West station. He was walking along the platform as the train left and he veered into the side of the moving train, spun around and fell through the gap between the train and the platform edge onto the track below. The passenger was fatally injured. No conclusive reason for the passenger veering into the side of the train could be established, but it was likely related to his impaired vision or, distraction, or a combination of both. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) determined that the passenger exchange at Newmarket West station had been made in average time and in accordance with the operating company's procedures, and that it had been appropriate for the train to move away from the platform when it did. The design of the platform met the New Zealand and international guidelines for assisting vision-impaired and blind persons. Newmarket West station was a temporary constructed station pending the build of a new station at Newmarket, and consequently part of the Down platform was constructed on a curved section of track, which meant the gap between the train and the platform edge was wide enough for the passenger to fall through when he walked into the side of the train. The Commission determined that the gap was as small as practicably achievable within the physical constraints of the station, and that warning signage and operating procedures were reasonable defences against this type of accident occurring. No practicable safety recommendations were identified that would prevent this type of accident happening again, but the report notes that the trend towards an ageing population with a likely increase in mobility-impaired people travelling on public transport will require designers of transport systems to remain vigilant to this trend. The safety actions noted in this report acknowledge this trend and propose strategies to meet future demand. The 2 platforms (including an adjacent Up platform) at Newmarket West station were demolished during the 2009/2010 Christmas/New Year holiday period concurrent with the opening of the redeveloped Newmarket station.",NA,Newmarket

RO-2010-101,"Wrong route setting, high-speed transit through turnout, near miss and SPAD (signal passed at danger), Tamaki, 13 August 2010
",13 Aug 2010,15 Nov 2012,10-101,"On 13 August 2010 a scheduled Auckland passenger train ('the passenger train') with about 100 people on board travelled from Papakura to Britomart Station in central Auckland via Westfield and Tamaki Stations. An unscheduled shunt was signalled to follow the passenger train from Westfield as far as Tamaki, so that it could enter a rail siding. There was a miscommunication when details of the shunt were passed from the Otahuhu to the Auckland signal box controller and as a result the Auckland signal box controller confused the running order of the 2 trains. Not realising that the shunt was behind the passenger train, he set the route at Tamaki to divert the shunt to the opposite Down Main line in preparation for entering the rail siding from there. This wrong route setting for the passenger train was the first of a set of 4 related incidents. A worksite had been set up within the Tamaki Station limits to enable work to be undertaken by the work gang. The Tamaki Station limits were a short distance from Panmure Station. The passenger train was supposed to stop at Panmure Station then continue through the worksite along the usual Up Main line. The driver of the passenger train was not aware that the route had been incorrectly set to divert his train to the Down Main line. His train had passed a yellow signal before Panmure, which told him that the next signal around the corner and out of sight from within Panmure Station was not displaying green. Instead the next signal was a 'low speed' signal, advising the driver that the points were set to divert his train to the Down Main line and that his train was to be travelling at no more than 25 kilometres per hour (km/h). The passenger train stopped and exchanged passengers at Panmure. The train was running behind schedule owing to several small delays. Before departing from Panmure Station the driver called the work gang and asked for permission to pass through the worksite. He was granted permission to pass through 'at normal speed'. The person in the work gang who responded had noticed that Points No.15 at Tamaki had moved to set the route for the next train across to the Down Main line, but did not mention this to the driver of the passenger train. Keen to make up lost time on the schedule, the driver accelerated the passenger train away from Panmure Station with the intention of reaching full speed. He appeared to have forgotten that the previous signal had been yellow and was not expecting the next signal to be a low-speed signal. His train rounded the bend, where he eventually noticed the next signal. Despite braking his train heavily, it went through the low-speed cross-over to the Down Main line at nearly twice the maximum speed limit of 25 km/h. This was the second incident. The passenger train reacted violently as it went through the cross-over to the other line, but did not roll over or derail. None of the people on board was injured, but some were shaken by the violent movement of the train. One of the track workers was walking beside the Down Main line at the time, with his back to the approaching passenger train. As the driver was bringing his train to a stop, it narrowly avoided striking the track worker. This was the third incident. The driver of the passenger train was also shaken by this experience, but after a short pause he decided that the signal box controller's intention must have been to re-route his train to the Up Main line farther down the track, so without speaking with the signal box controller or with train control, he moved his train along the Down Main line towards the next set of points. He was not looking at the signals, but instead was looking at the railway line ahead to check that the points were set to take his train across to the Up Main line. When he saw that they were not, he stopped his train, but not before he had passed a red signal that required him to stop. This was the fourth incident. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission's (the Commission's) findings included that the wrong route for the passenger train had been set through a combination of poor communication and failure to adhere to standard procedures when switching Tamaki Station to manual control. If the driver had driven his train to the signals, the wrong route setting should not have created any danger to his train and its occupants, but systems that had been put in place to help drivers remember previous signals were not well designed for the task and not routinely used by train drivers. Opportunities for correcting or preventing all 4 of these incidents were lost through substandard levels of crew resource management (CRM) that should have had all of the rail participants working as a team to manage safe railway operations. A lack of clarity in the daily work bulletin issued to all rail participants and the failure to follow standard procedures when switching the Tamaki Station signal box to manual contributed to the signal box controllers being unaware that a compulsory-stop-protected worksite existed within the Tamaki Station limits. A number of safety actions were taken by KiwiRail to address immediate safety issues around communication, and as part of the upgrade to the Auckland rail network the signal boxes involved with this incident have been decommissioned and incorporated into the Wellington National Train Control Centre. These safety actions have superseded the need for other safety recommendations. The Commission is making recommendations to the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency to address safety issues concerning: systems to help train drivers remember the status of signals their trains have already passed when having to deal with the distraction of stopping at intervening stations; and the clarity of daily work bulletins disseminating important operating information to rail personnel. The key lessons from the inquiry into this occurrence were: safe rail operations are reliant upon good communication between all operating personnel; all individuals and groups of individuals working in the rail industry need to understand fully and be working to a common objective before safe rail operations can be achieved; documents created for the purpose of providing essential information to rail participants should be clear, unambiguous and in a format suitable for the intended recipients.","023/12, 024/12",Tamaki
RO-2010-102,"Collision between 2 metro passenger trains after one struck a landslide and derailed between Plimmerton and Pukerua Bay, North Island Main Trunk, 30 September 2010
",30 Sep 2010,21 Jun 2012,10-102,"On Thursday 30 September 2010, Ganz passenger Train 6250 was travelling from Wellington to Paekakariki on the northbound main line with 44 passengers on board. It was raining heavily and had been for several hours. A landslide had come down from a cutting above the rail corridor and covered the northbound line with debris between Plimmerton and Pukerua Bay. The train was travelling at 60 kilometres per hour (km/h) when it rounded a curve and the driver saw the landslide. He made a full brake application but his train was still travelling at 59 km/h when it struck the landslide and derailed in the direction of the adjacent southbound main line. Train 6247 was another Ganz passenger train travelling from Paekakariki to Wellington on the southbound main line with 14 passengers on board. The driver saw the other train strike the landslide and derail when his train was about 250 m away from it. He made a full-service brake application but his train was still travelling at 54 km/h when it struck the then stationary derailed train a glancing blow, stopping about 75 m past the point of impact. Train 6247 did not derail. The driving compartments on both trains were on the right-hand sides and these absorbed most of the impact. Both drivers had predicted this and had left their driving compartments to escape injury and warn the passengers of the pending collision. The passenger compartments suffered broken windows and major structural damage. Nobody was seriously injured in the collision. The landslide had occurred sometime after 2 other trains had passed the location, 28 minutes earlier. MetService had issued a severe weather warning the day before, forecasting heavy rainfall for the Wellington area. The KiwiRail network control manager had received the warning and passed it on to the Wellington area manager, who had then passed it on to his gangers responsible for maintaining various sections of track within the area. Instead of the area manager deciding what to do, he left his gangers to decide whether to carry out any special track inspections or impose any speed restrictions for their respective sections of track. No special track inspections were made in the area of the landslide and no speed restrictions were put in place. The Commission made findings that a special track inspection might have revealed signs that a landslide was about to occur and that had a speed restriction been put in place, the initial derailment might not have been as severe and the opposing train would highly likely have been able to stop before meeting the derailed train; in other words the collision would have been avoided. The cutting where the landslide occurred was on an ""essential features list"" because of previous landslides that had occurred there. The slip site had been assessed by a KiwiRail geologist as part of a nationwide assessment of at-risk sites and had been identified as ranking 31 out of a list of 180 identified sites within the Wellington metro area. As such, the order of priority would not have seen remedial work at this site for at least another 2 years. The rainfall at the time of the landslide was calculated to have been an event expected to occur once in 15 years and the total rainfall recorded for the month of September was the highest since recording at the site began in 1991. The Commission made other findings about shortcomings in the design of the radio equipment on board the Ganz trains that meant train control was not automatically alerted to the accident when the drivers made emergency brake applications, and about the need to improve the crashworthiness of older trains that are going to be kept in service for any appreciable time. Since this accident, KiwiRail's safety actions have been to establish a series of online rainfall monitoring sites within the Wellington rail network. An interim decision-making matrix has been developed to assist area managers and gangers to decide when to undertake special track inspections and impose speed restrictions. The Commission made recommendations to address the safety issues of the crashworthiness of older trains and the fitting of modern radio equipment that will automatically alert train control when a train driver makes an emergency brake application. The key lessons from this inquiry are: in order to undertake an adequate risk assessment there must be a clearly mapped out methodology that should be followed; good, effective communication in any form is essential for preventing accidents occurring and essential for minimising the consequences if one does occur; people with designated responsibility must exercise that responsibility or delegate to another person to ensure important decisions are made at the right time.","021/12, 022/12",Plimmerton
RO-2011-101,"Wrong line running irregularity, leading to a potential head-on collision, Papakura - Wiri, 14 January 2011",14 Jan 2011,27 Apr 2012,11-101,"On Friday 14 January 2011, a train that was supposed to be stopped at Papakura was signalled to enter a section of track that another train had been authorised to enter from the opposite direction. A potential head-on collision was recognised by the person-in-charge of a nearby worksite and the situation was resolved before the second train entered the section. KiwiRail was upgrading the rail track between Papakura and Wiri stations in Auckland. The train programme had been reduced to allow this upgrade work to be undertaken, so only a small number of trains were scheduled to pass alongside the worksite. The worksite was in double-track territory and one of those tracks was open to trains. The train controller had planned to stop an Auckland-bound freight train at Papakura while a southbound passenger train crossed over to the northbound line for the journey from Wiri to Papakura, where it was to cross back over to its own southbound line. The procedure for the southbound train to travel on the wrong line required the issue of a Mis.60 authority. Both Wiri and Papakura stations had signal boxes that could be put under the control of signallers. This had been done for the duration of the upgrade work. The signallers worked the signals and points within their stations in accordance with the train controllers' plan. Safety for the worksite between Papakura and Wiri was under the control of a person-in-charge, and the worksite was protected at each end by compulsory stop boards. Every train had to stop at these boards and request permission from the person-in-charge to pass. This was to ensure that the track workers and machinery were clear of the track. The last signal controlling entry to the worksite at Papakura was Signal 3A. This was controlled by the Papakura signaller. The compulsory stop board was placed adjacent to Signal 3A. A blocking collar was required to be placed over the lever used to change Signal 3A in the signal box whenever the signaller was instructed to hold it at stop (red). On the day of the incident Signal 3A was supposed to be held at red for 2 reasons one, to protect the worksite and 2, because a Mis.60 had been issued to a train coming from the opposite direction. The blocking system was not designed to cater for more than one reason. Neither the driver of the northbound train nor the person-in-charge was told that the northbound train was to be held at Signal 3A for the southbound train. The person-in-charge gave the driver of the northbound train permission to pass the compulsory stop board and asked the signaller to change Signal 3A to proceed (green). The signaller forgot about the other train coming down the line on a Mis.60 and removed the blocking collar and changed the signal to green. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) has made findings about poor communication leading to the incident, about the design of the blocking system, and about the management and resourcing of signal boxes on the Auckland metro network. A number of safety actions were taken by KiwiRail and the train operator, Veolia, to address what would otherwise have been recommendations about the design of the blocking system, the management of and monitoring of signaller performance and standards, and communications with all parties involved in executing an agreed plan. The key lessons for the industry arising from this incident are: good communication of a plan is critical to its successful outcome; standards for measuring the performance and compliance of a workforce will only be effective if they are followed; audits will not be effective if the breaches they disclose are not acknowledged and remedied.",002/12,Papakura
RO-2011-102,"Track occupation irregularity, leading to near head-on collision, Staircase-Craigieburn, 13 April 2011
",13 Apr 2011,17 Oct 2013,11-102,"On Wednesday 13 April 2011, a loaded coal train was travelling through the Craigieburn-Staircase area on the Midland Line, en route from Ngakawau to Lyttelton. The coal train was travelling more slowly than usual because of infrastructure worksites in the area and because it had a problem with its dynamic brake operation. A KiwiRail track engineer called the train controller and asked for permission to ""on-track"" his alicart rail vehicle at Staircase and travel towards Craigieburn in order to reach a remote location not accessible by road. The train controller assumed without checking that the coal train had already passed Staircase going in the opposite direction, so she authorised the track occupation. The track engineer on-tracked the alicart and proceeded towards the oncoming coal train. A structures inspector working in the area at the time overheard the radio calls and recognised the potential for a near collision. He alerted the coal train driver, who then stopped his train, narrowly averting a head-on collision in a tunnel. The near collision occurred because the train controller did not comply with KiwiRail rules and procedures, which required her to check where the loaded coal train was before authorising the track engineer to on-track his alicart. There were also a number of wider systemic issues beyond the train controller’s control, which increased the risk of her making the error. These were: risk management of changes to train control – the plan to merge 2 train control areas partially into a single desk was not assessed and managed in a way that recognised its higher-than-usual level of risk; stress and fatigue management in train control – the train controller had been working almost 5 hours without a break on a single desk that covered one and a half geographic areas of train control. The train controller was mentally fatigued and suffering from reduced blood glucose levels due to insufficient food intake at the time she made her error; supervision of and support for train controllers – the train controller received no support and minimal supervision during her shift, even though she was performing a safety-critical function with a higher-than-usual level of risk; rest breaks for train controllers during a shift – the train controller did not have a rest or get something to eat during her 5-hour shift due to her high workload; the effects of planning and co-ordinating track infrastructure activity on train control workload – the train controller had an unrealistic workload for her to achieve a reasonable level of safety while operating the merged desk. The unrealistic workload was in part due to the train controller having to deal with too many ad-hoc requests by maintenance personnel for access to the track during periods of frequent train activity. This was in part caused by inadequate pre-planning of known maintenance activities across the rail network; train invisibility - train controllers cannot see, at a glance, where all trains and all rail service vehicles are on the rail network at any time, despite the availability of technology to achieve this. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) made four recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail and one to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to address these safety issues. The key lessons from this inquiry were: an organisation that performs a safety-critical function must have effective risk management systems in place. The responsibilities of everyone involved in managing and implementing these systems must be clearly defined and well understood; any changes to a safety-critical function that are likely to increase its risk profile must be properly risk assessed and managed; persons who perform safety-critical functions must be properly supervised and supported; an organisation that performs a safety-critical function should foster a workplace culture that encourages its people to ask for help and to support one another; train controllers must be given adequate breaks during their shifts to eat and rest; an organisation that performs a safety-critical function should have proper systems in place to detect and manage stress and fatigue in the workplace, including appropriate training and education; persons who perform safety-critical functions must not be unduly burdened by routine activities or distracted by unplanned activities; people who contact train control must conduct themselves in a way that does not distract train controllers. Their communication must be clear, concise and professional. They should not say more than is required.","013/13, 015/13, 017/13, 014/13, 016/13",Craigieburn
RO-2011-103,"Track workers nearly struck by passenger train near Paekakariki, North Island Main Trunk, 25 August 2011",26 Aug 2011,23 May 2013,11-103,"At about 1013 on Thursday 25 August 2011, electric multiple unit metro passenger Train 6225 (the passenger train) was travelling southbound from Waikanae to Wellington when it nearly struck 2 track workers who were repairing the track in a protected work area between Paekakariki and North Junction. The person in charge of the work area had given permission for the passenger train to enter the work area after the ""protection person"" had given him assurance that the track workers were off and clear of the track. The protection person, however, could not see the track workers from where he was standing, and had given the assurance without first checking that they were off and clear of the track. As the passenger train exited a curve travelling at about 60 kilometres per hour (km/h) the driver saw 2 members of a work group still on the track about 90 m ahead. He sounded the train whistle and applied maximum braking. The track workers managed to leap clear of the track just before the train passed. Neither was injured. The Commission found that the planning of the work had not been completed in accordance with KiwiRail procedures. A communication plan had not been submitted by the acting track ganger (track ganger) and even though an informal communication plan had been developed the day before work commenced, that plan was altered to accommodate a change in circumstances. The amended communication plan was inherently flawed, and it was a breakdown in communication that led to the serious incident. The Commission found that the work group collectively had insufficient experience in planning for and co-ordinating the work that day, and that the KiwiRail system for signing off, and the ongoing monitoring of infrastructure staff competency records, were incomplete and could not ensure that the staff involved were qualified to undertake their assigned duties. The protection person, who failed to check that his co-workers were off and clear of the track, had been a regular user of cannabis, and post-incident drug and alcohol testing carried out by KiwiRail revealed tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites (THC acid) in his urine. The Commission made recommendations to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to take the necessary action to ensure that KiwiRail's safety system for proving staff competencies is accurate and up to date; and to work with the National Rail System Standard Executive in developing an industry standard requiring all rail participants to have drug and alcohol policies that: have zero tolerance of performance-impairing substances for workers engaged in safety-critical tasks; require post-incident and accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol; and require a system for rail workers to report discreetly co-workers suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace. The key lessons learnt from the inquiry into this occurrence were: safe rail operations require the development of the right plan for the task; rail staff engaged in safety-critical work must be properly trained and hold current certification for the work undertaken; every step must be taken to prevent rail workers being affected by performance-impairing substances, particularly those involved with safety-critical tasks. Rail workers should have the opportunity to report discreetly co-workers suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace.","007/13, 006/13",Paekakariki
RO-2011-104,"Freight Train 261 collision with bus, Beach Road level crossing, Paekakariki, 31 October 2011",31 Oct 2011,13 Sep 2012,11-104,"On Monday 31 October 2011, a ""super-low-floor"" urban bus crossed the Beach Road level crossing at Paekakariki, 38.62 kilometres north of Wellington, and stopped at the road intersection with State Highway 1, where it became stuck. There were 3 sets of tracks at the level crossing and the bus encroached on 2 of these tracks. There were 6 passengers plus the driver on the bus. The driver tried various methods to free the bus but did not succeed. After about 5 minutes a freight train approached the level crossing at about 70 kilometres per hour (km/h) and collided with the rear of the bus. The driver and passengers had seen the train approaching and vacated the bus moments before the collision. The train driver was the only person on board the train. Nobody was injured in the collision. The bus was extensively damaged and the train was slightly damaged. The train did not derail. Had the bus not become stuck it could have pulled forward far enough to just clear the train on the main line when stopped at the stop sign, but there was not sufficient ""stacking distance"" available to ensure the bus was clear of the third set of tracks. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the bus complied with the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass for heavy road vehicles, but that the profile of the level crossing and short section of road leading up to the road intersection was not compatible with long and low road vehicles as required by the NZ Transport Agency Rules. The Commission also found that there was not a sufficient stacking distance for road vehicles longer than about 10 metres (m) to stop at the intersection as required and still remain clear of the level crossing. There are some 251 other level crossings in New Zealand with similar stacking distance issues. As a consequence of the collision, the bus operator has included the emergency telephone number for the National Train Control Centre in its vehicle operating plan, and has advised other bus operators of this safety action through an industry magazine. The Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency advise other operators of large road vehicles that their drivers should carry the National Train Control Centre emergency telephone number so that they can alert the train controller in any similar situation. The Commission made other recommendations about the layout, profile and stacking distance issues at the Beach Road level crossing, as well as with other level crossings and road intersections throughout New Zealand with similar issues. It also recommended that the NZ Transport Agency ensure that formal consultation takes place between key rail and road industry participants and regulators before changes are made to legislation that could affect other users. The key lessons from this inquiry are: changes to rules and standards for road transport can compromise safety at rail level crossings. Groups responsible for setting standards for road vehicles and rail level crossings should therefore consider the consequences for other users before making those changes drivers of long road vehicles need to know if there is not enough room for their vehicles between a road intersection and a rail level crossing","031/11, 026/12, 029/11, 030/11",Paekakariki
RO-2011-105,"Freight Train 228 wrong-routed, into closed section of track, Wiri Junction, South Auckland, 12 November 2011
",12 Nov 2011,9 Jan 2014,11-105,"On Saturday 12 November 2011 major rail infrastructure and maintenance work was underway on the section of track between Papakura and Westfield in South Auckland. One of the 2 tracks was closed for the works (the northbound track). A train controller in the national train control centre in Wellington was managing the flow of trains through the work area using the adjacent southbound track. Metropolitan passenger train services had been cancelled for the weekend to relieve congestion through the work area, but the freight train schedule was maintained. At about 1100 freight Train 228 was travelling north from Papakura to Westfield on the adjacent southbound track. The train was operating under an exemption from the train controller to travel in the wrong direction for that track as far as Westfield, a process called ""wrong-line-running"". However, the train controller mistakenly set the route for the train to cross back over to the closed northbound track at Wiri Junction (before Westfield). The train driver did not question the train controller on the apparent change in plan. Around the corner from Wiri Junction, a mobile crane was straddling the northbound track as it worked on removing a pedestrian overbridge. The train crossed over to the closed northbound track, and as it rounded the corner the driver saw the crane blocking the track ahead. He immediately applied the brakes and stopped his train 97 metres from the crane. The train controller was supposed to have applied ""control blocking"" to all signals and/or points where trains could potentially enter the closed work area, but he did not do this. Control blocking the signals/points was a process designed to prevent the train controller inadvertently setting the route for a train to enter the work area. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) could not identify the reason why the train controller made the errors. However, safety-critical systems should be safeguarded against one person's error resulting in an incident or an accident. The Commission identified 3 safety issues that either contributed to, or could have prevented, the incident: the KiwiRail rules did not require a cross-check confirmation that appropriate control blocking had been applied to protect the section of track closed for maintenance work; the train driver was reluctant to, and did not, challenge the train controller when he was given an instruction that he thought was not correct; the information provided in special work bulletins was not clear. KiwiRail immediately addressed the first safety issue. The Commission has made recommendations in previous inquiries which have addressed the other 2 safety issues. These 2 recommendations are still open, awaiting the completion of corrective actions from the NZ Transport Agency and KiwiRail. No new recommendations have been made. Key safety lessons arising from this incident include: rail work areas must be fully protected from all other rail activities before work begins, and there must be a positive confirmation between train controllers and persons in charge of work areas that the appropriate protections have been put in place; all rail staff must communicate properly and be prepared to challenge other staff, including perceived and actual superiors, if the plan is not proceeding as they understand it should; The KiwiRail Visitor Procedure Policy is an appropriate policy to protect the responsibilities of train controllers. KiwiRail should reinforce the importance of compliance with the Visitor Procedure Policy with train control employees.",NA,Puhinui
RO-2011-106,"Hi-rail vehicle nearly struck by passenger train, Crown Road level crossing near Paerata, North Island Main Trunk, 28 November 2011
",28 Nov 2011,21 Nov 2013,11-106,"Summary of the incident On 28 November 2011 a track maintenance gang arrived at the Crown Road level crossing near Paerata to relocate an 11-tonne hi-rail excavator from there to Pukekohe Station Yard about 5 kilometres (km) away. A scheduled passenger train with 7 people on board was due to pass through the Crown Road level crossing on its way to Pukekohe. The train controller had authorised an unscheduled ""training shuttle"" train to proceed to Pukekohe several minutes ahead of the scheduled passenger train. The training shuttle looked just like the scheduled passenger train. Several minutes after the training shuttle had passed over the Crown Road level crossing, the person-in-charge of the track maintenance gang radioed the train controller and told him that ""a subby [which was meant to be a reference to the scheduled suburban passenger train] had just gone past"" and he requested track time to take the hi-rail excavator to Paerata. The train controller assumed that the person-in-charge was referring to the passenger train and, without checking, authorised him to place a hi-rail vehicle and the hi-rail excavator on the tracks in front of the approaching passenger train. A short time later the train controller noticed the passenger train appear on his mimic screen and realised his error. He alerted the person-in-charge, who managed to get the hi-rail vehicle clear of the track just seconds before the passenger train passed, narrowly avoiding a collision. The train controller's mistake was failing to check the whereabouts of the passenger train. He did not make that check, because he made an assumption based on the person-in-charge of the worksite saying a ""subby"" had just passed his location. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) has identified 3 safety issues that contributed to the incident: the train controller acted on an assumption rather than following proper procedures before authorising the track occupation ahead of the passenger train; the passenger train was travelling through a section of track where it was not electronically visible to the train controller when he authorised the track occupation; the train controller had not consumed any food for about 15 hours before the incident and it could not be excluded that his performance was affected by his having a low blood glucose level. The report also discusses another factor that contributed to the incident. The driver of the passenger train had reduced the volume on his train radio to a lower level, so he was not aware that the train controller had authorised the maintenance gang to occupy the section of track ahead of his train. This meant that the driver missed the opportunity to alert the train controller to the potential collision. Other incidents involving train control This is the second time within recent months that the Commission has looked closely at train control. In September 2013 the Commission completed an inquiry into a near-collision incident between Staircase and Craigieburn involving a loaded coal train with 2 people on board and an alicart driven by a track engineer. The Staircase/Craigieburn incident occurred about 7 months before this one. It involved a train controller failing to check the location of the loaded coal train before authorising the track engineer to ""on-track"" his alicart and travel towards the loaded coal train on the same section of track. The collision was avoided after a structures inspector in the general area overheard the radio conversation between the train controller and the track engineer and raised the alarm. As a result of its inquiry into the Staircase/Craigieburn incident, the Commission became concerned about a number of wider systemic issues that it had found within train control, including: the lack of a proper risk assessment of the merger of 2 train control desks; poor supervision of and support for the train controller in that case, who had become increasingly stressed and mentally fatigued during her shift; the standard protocol of not allowing scheduled breaks for train controllers. Although the safety issues identified in the Staircase/Craigieburn incident are not precisely the same as those in this incident, both incidents raised concern with the performance of train control. The Commission has made one new recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail and referenced 2 existing open recommendations from the earlier Staircase/Craigieburn report to address the safety issues identified in this report. It has also made one new recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to ensure that KiwiRail address the safety issues. The key lessons learnt from the inquiry were: train controllers need to verify all information before authorising a track occupations. If they cannot see trains by some electronic means, they must make radio contact with the drivers to verify the trains’ locations in order to give authorisations; the risk of train controllers making assumptions must be managed on an on-going basis; train controllers who are significantly fatigued (mentally) during their shifts can be a risk to public transport safety. Having a proper diet and nutrition, and taking rest breaks during shifts are crucial for minimising this risk; food must be easily accessible by train controllers, and train controllers must be given adequate breaks during their shifts to enable them to eat and to rest.","025/13, 026/13",Paerata

",6 Apr 2012,10 Apr 2015,12-101,"On 6 April 2012 the 9.5-tonne body of a damaged freight wagon (the load) was being carried on a purpose-built ""special-movement wagon"" (the wagon). The wagon was one of 60 on a northbound freight train travelling from Dunedin to Christchurch. At some time before the train reached Ashburton the webbing strops used to lash the load to the wagon failed, allowing the load to move and overhang the side of the wagon by at least one metre. Over a distance of about 64 kilometres the overhanging load struck and damaged or destroyed 10 track-side signals and 2 barrier arm assemblies at a road level crossing. At Rolleston another freight train was stationary on an adjacent track, waiting for the northbound train to pass. The overhanging load struck the locomotive of the stationary train. The driver of the stationary train alerted the other driver, who stopped his train. The stationary train received minor damage. No-one was injured in the accident. The webbing strops failed because an insufficient number of them had been used to secure the load, and edge protectors, which were required to prevent the webbing strops fraying, had not been used. The load had not been secured in compliance with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code (issue 3, effective from 7 September 2009). The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that no-one involved with loading, shifting and securing the wagon body was sufficiently familiar with the KiwiRail Freight Handling Code to realise that the securing arrangement was not compliant with the Code. The Commission has made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to address this safety issue. The Commission also found that the wagon allocated to transport the load from Dunedin to Christchurch had not been furnished with the appropriate load-securing equipment. KiwiRail took the appropriate safety action to address this safety issue. Key lessons learnt from this inquiry were:  poorly secured loads on trains have the potential to cause significant damage to property and injury to persons, which is why the persons responsible for securing and checking the security of loads must be familiar with the requirements of the operator's Freight Handling Code; the proper freight-securing equipment must be easily available to staff to ensure they can correctly apply the standards of the Freight Handling Code.","008/14, 009/14",Rolleston

As a consequence, all of the signals in the Auckland metropolitan area automatically reverted to red (""Stop"") and all rail movements in Auckland progressively stopped. Train controllers were unable to communicate with the stranded trains and could not issue control instructions. Veolia was advised of the power outage and immediately activated its emergency plan. Veolia sent messages to all its on-board train managers, explaining the situation. All passengers were retained on board trains that were prevented from reaching their next stations. The power outage lasted for about one hour and scheduled passenger services were affected for the rest of the evening. There were 27 train services travelling within the Auckland metro area at the time, with an estimated passenger load of between 1000 and 2000. The power outage occurred when an electrical fault caused an electrical circuit breaker that was feeding power to all four Auckland workstations to trip. The electrical fault should have first tripped a different circuit breaker, which would have resulted in only one of the four workstations being lost. The control of all signals for the Auckland metropolitan area had been centralised into Wellington train control since 1997. The last phase of centralisation was the provision of the four new workstations that subsequently lost power in this incident. All train control functions for the Auckland metropolitan area had been managed from these four workstations since late 2010, about 16 months before the incident. The Commission identified the following safety issues: the project team responsible for the Auckland train control centralisation project lacked the appropriate expertise for designing and installing the emergency power supply system; the management and maintenance of the emergency power supply system for train control were not sufficient to ensure the integrity of what had been designated an ""essential service""; KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy for ""continuity of core services"" did not give proper consideration to the safety of passengers and crew when a core service such as train control failed, causing the widespread stoppage of an entire metropolitan passenger rail system. KiwiRail took the necessary safety action to improve the management and maintenance of the power supply system for train control. The Commission made one recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to review its risk assessment matrix to improve the focus on safety risk. The key lessons learnt from the inquiry into this occurrence were: projects involving essential core services must be appropriately scoped and resourced to ensure that the service integrity is not disrupted at any time; essential core services must be subjected to a rigorous safety risk assessment process that ensures that the risks to people and infrastructure are appropriately managed and tested; power distribution systems for essential core services must be properly managed and serviced to ensure that the integrity of the service is maintained.",022/14,Auckland
RO-2012-103,"Derailment of freight Train 229, Rangitawa-Maewa, North Island Main Trunk, 3 May 2012
",3 May 2012,2 Jun 2016,12-103,"A KiwiRail Holdings Limited freight train (Train 229) consisting of two locomotives hauling 33 wagons was travelling from Auckland to Wellington overnight on 2 and 3 May 2012. At 0034 on 3 May one of four sets of wheels on the fifth wagon derailed. The wagon was dragged for nearly three kilometres in that state to a rail junction at Maewa, about 22 kilometres north of Palmerston North, where it and five other wagons completely derailed. Another freight train that was waiting in the Maewa crossing loop escaped damage. However, there was substantial damage to the six derailed wagons and track infrastructure at Maewa. The train was not conveying any dangerous goods cargo and no one was injured in the derailment. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the most likely cause of the derailment was a phenomenon called dynamic interaction, when the track geometry, wagon condition, wagon loading and train speed in combination can cause a wagon to rock from side to side. One or more wheels then lift and climb the rail, resulting in a derailment. The wagon condition, wagon loading and speed of the train were all found to be within KiwiRail's maximum permissible limits. However, a series of track defects approaching the derailment site was outside KiwiRail's permissible limits. The Commission also found that there had been a history of track defects approaching the derailment site that had not been effectively repaired, which had highly likely contributed to a derailment at the same location six and a half weeks prior to this accident. The KiwiRail system for managing track defects in the area of Maewa was not ensuring: that the root causes of track defects were being identified; that repair work was being properly performed; and that the repairs were effective. KiwiRail has since taken safety actions to address these issues. Noting the safety actions taken by KiwiRail and the trend of decreasing mainline derailments in that period and since, the Commission has made no new recommendations. A key lesson arising from this inquiry is that any action taken to address track defects must be conducted properly, then checked and monitored to ensure the desired results have been achieved.",NA,Maewa
RO-2012-104,"Train 723 overran limit of track warrant Parikawa, Main North line, 1 August 2012
",1 Aug 2012,17 Sep 2015,12-104,"On Wednesday 1 August 2012, a southbound freight train was travelling from Picton to Christchurch. At the same time a northbound freight train was travelling from Christchurch to Picton. The train controller had planned to cross the trains at the Pines track warrant station. The train controller had issued a track warrant to the driver of the southbound train to proceed to Parikawa only, the track warrant station before Pines. The track warrant terminated at Parikawa because the train controller had authorised a hi-rail vehicle associated with a track maintenance work group to occupy the track between Parikawa and Pines. The driver of the southbound train correctly wrote Parikawa as the terminating track warrant station, but subsequently formed the belief that his track warrant terminated at Pines instead. The southbound train passed through Parikawa and stopped at Pines. Fortunately, the driver of the hi-rail vehicle had completed his task and removed his vehicle from the track; otherwise there would have been a high risk of collision between the train and his vehicle. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) was not able to determine conclusively at what point and why the train driver formed the belief that his train had authority to proceed through Parikawa to Pines.The Commission found that the train driver's roster alone was unlikely to have caused the driver to be fatigued. However, there were other factors that could have been affecting the quality of sleep obtained. The Commission found that the train driver's performance was likely to have been affected by a number of medications that he had been prescribed in response to work- and non-work-related injuries. The Commission identified the following safety issues: the train driver, who was performing a safety-critical role, had been prescribed a number of potentially performance-impairing medications without the knowledge of the industry health professionals; there was no requirement for private medical practitioners to inform the rail industry medical professionals when they became aware that a person who performed a safety-critical role had medical conditions or had been prescribed performance-impairing medications that could render that person unfit for normal duty; there was no requirement for the driver to complete the safety-critical worker health questionnaire before he presented for a special 'triggered' health assessment; there was little or no warning system built in to KiwiRail’s procedures to mitigate the risk of the track warrant control operating system failing due to human error. The Commission made one recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency, one recommendation to the Secretary for Transport and one recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to address these safety issues. The Commission identified that the key lessons learnt from the inquiry into this occurrence were: over-the-counter and prescribed medications have the potential to affect the performance of train drivers and other persons working in safety-critical roles. Any person working in a safety-critical role should notify an industry health professional of any such medication before presenting for further duty; drivers of trains operating under track warrant authority who do not follow the correct procedures are more likely to endanger lives by causing accidents; train controllers who do not follow the correct procedures for controlling trains in track warrant territory are more likely to endanger lives by causing accidents; this report gives an example of KiwiRail not following or enforcing a procedure in its safety system relating to periodic health assessments. A rail operator that does not strictly enforce its own standards will risk engendering a culture of non-compliance among its employees.","008/15, 011/15, 009/15",Parikawa
RO-2012-105,"Unsafe recovery from wrong-route at Wiri Junction, 31 August 2012",31 Aug 2012,19 May 2016,12-105,"On Friday 31 August 2012 a scheduled Auckland metropolitan passenger train was travelling south from Britomart Station to Manukau Station. The train had stopped at Puhinui Station to exchange passengers. While it was sitting at the station, train control set the wrong route for the train through Wiri Junction. The route was set to take the train straight through to Papakura instead of diverging to the Manukau Branch Line. The signal ahead of the train was showing the driver that his train was routed for Papakura instead of Manukau. However, the driver did not recognise this. The train controller realised his mistake and radioed the train driver with the intention of having him stop his train, but was too late to prevent the train entering the Wiri Junction section. On this occasion there was no conflicting traffic and the train was in no danger of overturning because the driver had kept the train speed down to 40 kilometres per hour on the assumption that his train would be routed across to the Manukau Branch Line. However, a serious incident occurred during the process of recovering the train to the correct route. Through miscommunication between the train driver and the train controller, the driver drove his train straight back in the direction from which it had come, towards another passenger train approaching on the same line. The trains stopped about 800 metres apart. There was no collision and no-one was injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the wrong-routing occurred during a transitional period when train controllers were becoming familiar with the newly commissioned Manukau Branch Line. They altered an existing routine that for a time increased the risk of human error. The Commission also found that the driver assumed the route ahead had been correctly set for his train then selectively read the 'proceed' aspect of signal 1803, but he did not recognise that it was also displaying the wrong route for his train. The key safety issue arising from this incident was the miscommunication between the driver and the train controller, resulting from an ambiguous conversation when a set of clear and precise instructions were required but not relayed. The Commission has already made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency in 2012 about ensuring high standards of crew resource management and communication across the rail industry. Since this incident KiwiRail has automated the train route selection for Wiri Junction, which should significantly reduce the likelihood of a future Manukau-bound train being signalled a wrong route through Wiri Junction. In view of the above, the Commission has made no new recommendations arising from this inquiry. The key lessons arising from this inquiry are: train drivers must actively look at, correctly interpret and respond to all signals, rather than making assumptions about what lies ahead of their trains; communication between train controllers and train drivers must be clear and concise and leave both parties in no doubt as to what is going to happen next, particularly when resolving abnormal situations.",NA,Wiri
RO-2013-101,"Derailment of freight Train 345, Mission Bush Branch line, 9 January 2013
",9 Jan 2013,15 Jun 2017,13-101,"A KiwiRail freight train consisting of three locomotives hauling 36 wagons departed Glenbrook bound for Mount Maunganui at 0430 on 9 January 2013. When the train departed the brakes were working only on the three locomotives, and not the wagons (the train brake) due to the train braking system not being configured properly in the non-driving end of the lead locomotive. Also, the coupling between the sixth and seventh wagons in the train had not been secured properly. The train parted between the sixth and seventh wagons while descending a grade from Glenbrook. Within a matter of seconds, the rear portion of the train ran into the forward portion, causing the derailment. The track infrastructure and 28 wagons carrying steel product were extensively damaged. The line was closed for three and a half days while repairs were completed. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the train was able to depart with a wrongly configured brake control system due to there being no mechanical interlock preventing it moving. The Commission also found that the fact that the train brakes were not working when the train departed Glenbrook should have been detected, but was not, because the required brake test had not been performed after a third locomotive was added to the train. The Commission has made no recommendations because of the safety actions taken by KiwiRail Holdings Limited following the derailment and the trend of decreasing mainline derailments during the period of this investigation. Key lessons identified from this inquiry are: train drivers and train examiners need to comply with basic operating rules to ensure that trains have fully functioning and continuous air brake systems at all times; it is important that all operating staff communicate properly and effectively and ensure that proper procedures are followed. Should there be any departure from the plan or any unusual or unexplained event occur, it must be communicated effectively; shift workers need to remain alert to any situation that could affect their cognitive performance, and that of their work colleagues.",NA,Mission Bush
RO-2013-102,"Passenger train travelled with doors open, Wingate - Taita, 28 March 2013
",28 Mar 2013,26 Jun 2014,13-102,"On 28 March 2013, a Tranz Metro six-car Ganz Mavag electric multiple unit train was running an evening peak-hour passenger service from Wellington to Taita. The train was being driven by a trainee driver (trainee) undergoing on-the-job training. His performance was being monitored by a ""minder driver"", who was sitting across from and outside the driver's cab. The train stopped at its penultimate stop, Wingate station, where a number of passengers disembarked. The train manager and her assistant were standing on the platform overseeing the passenger operations. When the passengers were clear of the train the assistant was about to re-board the fourth ""car"". At the same time the train manager was reaching through the doorway on the third car, preparing to close the passenger doors, when the train began to move forward. Both stepped back from the train and were left standing on the platform as the train departed. Normally the train manager would have pressed a ""right-away"" button on the door control box once all the passenger doors had closed, which would have simultaneously sounded a buzzer and illuminated a light on the driver's control panel. This would have been the driver's signal that the train had been cleared to depart. The trainee thought he had heard the buzzer, so he applied power and the train departed for the last stop at Taita station with 12 passengers on board. He did not notice that the separate ""all-doors-closed"" light was not illuminated on his control panel. The short journey to Taita was made with all 12 passenger doors along one side of the train open and with no passenger staff on board. No-one was injured. There was no damage to the train. A safety issue arising from this inquiry was the design of the door-status light system. The light was normally extinguished when the doors were open, even while the train was moving. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) accepted a submission from the Greater Wellington Regional Council, which said that it did not intend to modify the door-status light system on the Ganz Mavag sets, because they are due to be withdrawn from service within two years. The train manager was not carrying a portable radio of the kind that Tranz Metro had placed on board all its trains to enable train managers to converse with drivers in emergency situations. The train manager could have alerted the trainee to the incident had Tranz Metro allowed her to carry the radio. The Commission has made a recommendation in the past about train managers being provided with radios to allow effective communication in the event of an emergency. This recommendation is discussed in the context of this incident. Key safety lessons arising from this incident included: driver indication systems in rail vehicles should be designed logically to provide the intended warnings for the drivers in a clear and unambiguous way; there should always be a method provided for train managers to contact train drivers directly in cases of emergency, and those methods should be fully utilised.",NA,Wingate
RO-2013-103,"Passenger train collisions with Melling Station stop block, 15 April 2013 and 27 May 2014
",15 Apr 2013,8 Dec 2016,13-103,"On 15 April 2013 a two-car Matangi passenger train was operating the service from Wellington to Melling Station. As the train was slowing on the approach to Melling Station it encountered slippery track conditions, and despite the efforts of the train driver the train collided with the stop block just past the station platform. The train was damaged and three passengers received first aid, with one sustaining minor injuries. The force of the collision lifted the concrete stop block out of the ground. Just over one year later, on 27 May 2014, the same thing happened when another two-car Matangi passenger train collided with the stop block. This time the train came to rest on top of the stop block. The concrete block split and the terminal pole for the overhead power line, mounted directly behind the stop block, was severed at ground level. The overhead contact wire drooped and momentarily touched the roof of the train, causing the electrical circuit breaker to trip for the area. The train was extensively damaged and two passengers received minor injuries. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that for both accidents dew forming on the railway track following a period of dry weather made the track slippery (referred to as low adhesion). Both trains were being driven normally but the drivers were caught unaware by the slippery track conditions. The Commission also found that the training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag train type to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems. The computer-controlled train braking system is sophisticated and is fitted with two independent wheel-slide protection systems to manage braking in slippery conditions. Post-accident testing revealed that the braking systems had not been optimised for slippery track conditions when the trains were first commissioned into service. The Commission identified a safety issue whereby the current National Rail System Standards did not require new train types to have their train brake systems tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard. The Commission also identified safety issues with the assessment of risk for trains entering terminating stations. The normal allowable train speeds left little margin for error in the event of something going wrong, and the stop block was an older type and was less effective at absorbing impact forces than its modern equivalent. Also, the pole supporting the overhead electrical traction line was directly in the path of an overrunning train. It was of concern to the Commission that the driver of the train in the second accident was found to have cannabis in his system, although it does not believe that it was a contributory factor. The Commission made four urgent recommendations to KiwiRail to address issues to do with risk, and two further recommendations to the NZ Transport Agency to ensure that low-adhesion braking requirements were defined in rail standards and that the brake systems on the new Auckland electric trains were optimised for low-adhesion conditions. Actions were taken to address four of the recommendations, which were then closed before this report was published. The agencies involved have also made progress in addressing the remaining recommendations, and taken safety actions to address other safety issues identified in this report. Detail of the safety actions taken are included in sections six and seven of this report. In summary, they are: The train brakes were tested and optimised for slippery track conditions; The line speed into Melling Station was reduced and the line speed at other terminal stations was reviewed and changed as appropriate; The stop block at Melling was replaced with a shock absorbing buffer stop; The traction power pole at Melling was relocated away from the track centreline; Matangi drivers received further training on the Matangi brake systems; Overhead traction power reset procedures were changed; A low adhesion working group was formed for the Wellington area; The procurement of a driver training simulator for Matangi trains was initiated; The driving console in the Matangi trains was modified to alert the driver whenever the train was experiencing wheelslide activity. Key lessons arising from this inquiry were: Slippery track conditions are a foreseeable risk and train braking systems must be designed, tested and optimised to provide adequate braking performance under those condition; Train drivers must be adequately trained to be fully conversant with the characteristics of their train braking systems, and to drive their trains within the trains' capabilities; When a new train type is being commissioned and first entered into service, train operators should seek feedback from the drivers on train performance in order to identify and remedy promptly any potential performance issues.",NA,Melling
RO-2013-104,"Derailment of metro passenger Train 8219 Wellington, 20 May 2013
",20 May 2013,17 Sep 2015,13-104,"On Monday 20 May 2013, Train 8219 was the scheduled Tranz Metro passenger train travelling from Porirua to Wellington. The train was an electric multiple unit consisting of four passenger coaches. At 0743 the rear coach of the train derailed as it was entering Wellington Station limits. Four of the 315 passengers on board the train received minor injuries. The derailed coach remained upright but sustained extensive damage to machinery underneath the coach floor. An air compressor was forced up through the coach floor into the passenger compartment. A component from the train's braking system had fallen onto the track and jammed against the underslung machinery with sufficient force to cause the derailment. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the component fell because, more than 10 weeks before the accident, maintenance staff had omitted to fit retaining split pins to bolts that were holding the component in place. The maintenance staff had not been given specific task instructions to follow and against which to record progress. Because of this, when the task of fitting the brake component was interrupted by an overnight change in shift, the omission of fitting the retaining split pins was easily missed. Before its inquiry was complete the Commission made urgent recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to address safety issues with the way maintenance was conducted in its Wellington maintenance depot. The Commission also recommended that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency monitor the progress of KiwiRail's response to the recommendations. The Commission identified the following key lesson arising from this inquiry: maintenance staff must be given clear instructions for all maintenance tasks and record progress against every important step of the instructions. If a task involves safety-critical systems, there must be an independent check by a responsible person before the train is released back into service.","020/13, 021/13",Wellington
RO-2013-105,"Capital Connection passenger train, departed Waikanae Station with mobility hoist deployed, 10 June 2013
",10 Jun 2013,7 May 2015,13-105,"At 0730 on Monday 10 June 2013, the KiwiRail Scenic-operated passenger train the Capital Connection was en route from Palmerston North to Wellington and had stopped at Waikanae Station to exchange passengers. The train was fitted with a mobility hoist in the rear-most luggage van for boarding and alighting passengers in wheelchairs. The train manager was monitoring the passenger exchange from the station platform adjacent to the leading passenger car near the front of the train. When he thought that the passenger exchange was complete, he re-entered the leading passenger car and closed all the passenger car doors from the local train door operating panel. After receiving an all-doors-closed green light, the train manager authorised the train driver to depart. Meanwhile, at the rear of the train the train attendant was operating the mobility hoist to alight a passenger in a wheelchair and their support person. The train attendant deployed the mobility hoist with the two passengers onto the station platform, at which time the train began to move. The train attendant pressed the train emergency stop button, which stopped the train, it having travelled about 1.7 metres. No-one was injured and no damage resulted. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the incident occurred because: the operation of the mobility hoist had not been written into the departure procedure being followed by the train manager; there was no effective means for the train attendant who was operating the mobility hoist to communicate with the train manager; the status of the luggage van doors was not interlocked with the train door status and control system, which allowed the train manager to receive a green all-doors-closed signal in spite of the luggage van door being open and the mobility hoist deployed onto the platform. The Commission has not made recommendations because KiwiRail has taken the appropriate safety action to address these three safety issues. The key safety lessons arising from this inquiry were: operational procedures must cover an entire operation if accidents and incidents are to be avoided; good communication among all persons involved in safety-critical operations is essential if accidents and incidents are to be avoided; technical solutions to mitigate human error, such as train door interlocking systems, are only effective if they protect all parts of the system.",NA,Waikanae
RO-2013-106,"Track occupation irregularity, leading to near head-on collision, Otira-Arthur's Pass, 10 June 2013
",10 Jun 2013,4 Dec 2014,13-106,"On the afternoon of 10 June 2013, KiwiRail's Tranz Alpine passenger train was travelling from Greymouth to Christchurch. The train departed from the Otira station on time, heading for the western portal of the Otira Tunnel. At about the same time, signals technicians had finished work on testing the tunnel door and ventilation systems at the western portal of the tunnel. About one minute after the train had departed from Otira, one of the signals technicians radioed train control and requested a track occupation authority to drive their two road vehicles across the rail bridge (Bridge 50) in the opposite direction from which the train was approaching. The train controller assumed from the signals technician's request that the passenger train had already crossed Bridge 50 and entered the tunnel. Based on that assumption he gave them authority to cross the bridge, in the path of the approaching train. The driver of the passenger train overheard the track occupation being authorised and realised that it conflicted with his train's movement. He reduced power and brought his train to a gradual stop before reaching Bridge 50, and alerted the train controller to the conflict. The train controller had not followed KiwiRail's track occupation rules, which required him to verify the actual location of the train in the area before authorising the road vehicles to cross the bridge. He had three means at his disposal to verify where the train was located. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the train controller’s performance was highly likely to have been impaired by fatigue at the time of the incident. His fatigue was the effect of his shift roster in the weeks leading up to the incident, which did not allow him sufficient opportunity to obtain good quality sleep and recover adequately from sleep debt accumulated during his cycle of shifts. The Commission identified two safety issues that contributed to the incident: the standard roster that the train controller was working in the weeks leading up to the incident did not offer him sufficient opportunity to recover adequately from sleep debt incurred after a shift cycle; the train controller had been involved in three operating irregularities during the previous 16-months and KiwiRail had identified his having concentration and focus issues. Despite this KiwiRail had allowed him to continue in the train controller role. The report refers to previous recommendations the Commission has made to KiwiRail and the NZ Transport Agency regarding train control rosters, fatigue and train controller wellbeing. The circumstances of this incident are relevant to both recommendations, and justify the Commission leaving them open until the safety issues identified in this report have been fully addressed. The key lessons learnt from the inquiry into this occurrence were: it is important that train controllers do not make assumptions about the locations of trains when authorising track occupations, and do not use local or ad hoc practices to circumvent policies, procedures and rules designed to prevent accidents and incidents; train control is a safety-critical function. If there is any doubt about a train controller's performance, they should be stood down until all doubt is removed; the 24-hour train control roster should be designed to minimise and manage the risk of train controllers' performance being impaired by fatigue.",023/14,Otira
RO-2013-107,"Express freight MP16 derailment, Mercer, North Island Main Trunk, 3 September 2013
",3 Sep 2013,14 Apr 2016,13-107,"On Tuesday 3 September 2013 an express freight train operated by KiwiRail was travelling from Tauranga to Auckland. The train consisted of a single locomotive hauling 36 wagons, 14 of which were conveying hazardous goods. At about 0300, as the train was approaching Mercer, a wheel-bearing on the 20th wagon behind the locomotive failed, resulting in that wagon derailing and tipping onto the adjacent southbound track. The following two wagons also derailed, one of them spilling its container and contents onto the adjacent State Highway One Expressway. Nobody was injured but significant damage occurred to the derailed wagons, their cargo and the rail infrastructure. Not enough of the failed wheel-bearing could be found to make a meaningful analysis of why it failed. However, there is some indication that previous issues with the wagon's braking system were a factor contributing to the failure. KiwiRail had installed a wheel-bearing acoustic monitoring system at three locations on the rail network to gather data on, and detect any signs of, pending wheel-bearing failure. The Commission found that the wheel-bearing acoustic monitoring system had detected impending problems with the failed wheel-bearing. However, because the system had yet to be fully implemented and resourced, the impending failure was not acted on in time to prevent the derailment. The Commission noted the potentially serious consequences of mainline train derailments, particularly in double track areas and where the rail track comes close to roads and public areas. However, it also noted the trend of decreasing mainline derailments since the installation of the wheel-bearing acoustic monitoring system. One recommendation has been made to the chief executive of KiwiRail to improve the accuracy of recording events involving train braking system failures to provide another predictive tool for detecting and preventing premature wheel-bearing failure. A key lesson arising from the inquiry is that, in order to achieve the full benefit of new technology introduced for the purpose of increasing rail safety, proper processes for applying the technology must also be introduced and sufficient staff provided who are fully conversant with those processes.",001/16,Mercer
RO-2013-108,"Near collision between 2 metro passenger trains, Wellington, 9 September 2013
",9 Sep 2013,21 Nov 2013,13-108,"On Monday 9 September 2013 at 1336, the NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) of the incident under section 13(4) of the Railways Act 2005. The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990, to determine the circumstances and causes of the incident, and appointed an investigator-in-charge. The investigator in charge interviewed the train driver and the train manager from Train 9243 and the train driver from the empty passenger train on Monday 9 September 2013. He also interviewed the KiwiRail Limited signaller who was on duty in the Wellington signal box at the time of the incident. The Commission reviewed data from the Tranzlog event recorders and forward-facing closed-circuit video recording systems on both trains, and data from the signalling system logs for the Johnsonville Line and Wellington station. On 13 September 2013 the investigator rode in the cab on the same service to observe the aspects that would have been seen by a train approaching Signal 38 at stop. The Commission received information relating to the history of the apparatus associated with Signal 38. The Commission also reviewed KiwiRail's general policy and Tranz Metro’s procedures covering the issue of train driver distraction. On 25 September 2013 the Commission approved the draft final report for circulation to interested persons for comment. On 23 October 2013 the Commission reviewed the submissions and changes to the draft report were made where appropriate. The Commission approved the final report for publication on the same date. Recommendations were made to KiwiRail and NZ transport Agency: KiwRail: The near collision occurred at a convergence of several busy metro passenger lines and there was no automatic protection applied to preventing such a collision in the event of a driver failing to stop at Signal 38. Equivalent signals protecting other lines into Wellington station have been fitted with signal trips that automatically apply a train's brakes in the event of it overrunning the signal. A signal trip fitted to Signal 38 would have automatically applied the passenger train brakes in this case. On 23 October 2013, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail install some form of protection that will automatically stop a train that has overrun Signal 38 in the Wellington Station area, and that he reviews other signalling arrangements in busy, high risk metro passenger areas to ensure the same arrangements are in place to minimise the risk of train collisions for the same or similar reasons. Driver distraction has the potential to contribute to or cause serious accidents and incidents. In this case the driver of the passenger train was distracted by engaging in a non-operational conversation with the train manager, and failed to stop his train at a red signal. On 23 October 2013, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail takes the necessary action to reinforce to all staff the existing rule forbidding non-operational conversation with train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance with the rule. NZ Transport Agency: The Commission has made 2 recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail, that he: Install some form of protection that will automatically stop a train that has overrun Signal 38 in the Wellington station area, and that he review other signalling arrangements in busy, high-risk metro passenger areas to ensure that the same arrangements are in place to minimise the risk of train collisions for the same or similar reasons. Take the necessary action to reinforce to all staff the existing rule forbidding non-operational conversations with train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance with the rule.

The train passed through Te Kauwhata station at 0937 with 108 passengers and five crew on board, heading towards the Te Onetea Road level crossing about 3.5 kilometres further south. Meanwhile a truck and long low-loader carrying a road roller was travelling along the no-exit Te Onetea Road, the driver looking for a suitable place to turn his long vehicle around. The truck was approaching the Te Onetea Road rail level crossing at the same time that the train was coming into view. The Te Onetea Road level crossing had passive controls protected by 'Stop' and 'Look for Trains' signs. The truck driver entered the level crossing without stopping and his trailer unit grounded on the rise leading up to the rail tracks. The truck became stuck, with its driving unit obstructing the track along which the train was approaching. The train driver saw the truck begin to pass over the level crossing and stop in the path of his train. Despite his sounding the locomotive whistle and applying emergency braking, the train collided with the driving unit at a speed of 78 kilometres per hour. The truck was substantially damaged and the truck driver was killed in the collision. The train did not derail and suffered minor damage to the locomotive only. None of the train passengers or crew was injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that in this case the train, which had its headlight and side 'ditch lights' switched on, would have been visible to the truck driver as his truck reached the stop signs at the level crossing. Had the driver stopped his truck and looked for trains, the accident would likely not have happened. However, there were broader safety issues with the level crossing that in different circumstances may have resulted in the accident, even if the driver had stopped at the limit line of the level crossing. The Commission identified two safety issues. The first was that the view lines from the stop limit line on the road, along the rail tracks in both directions, did not comply with the minimum restart sighting distances set out in the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual, Part 9, Level Crossings. It was therefore possible that when a train was just out of a truck driver's view, a fully road-compliant heavy road vehicle would not have sufficient time to pass over the level crossing without being struck by the train. The second safety issue identified was that level crossing assessments do not require the road profile and the alignment of roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured. Therefore, there are no checks made to ensure that all road-legal vehicles can pass over level crossings without becoming stuck, as happened in this case. The Commission has made two recommendations to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to address these safety issues. A key safety lesson arising from this accident is that drivers of road vehicles must comply with compulsory stop signs at rail level crossings to give them ample opportunity to look for trains, assess the situation and consider any risk before proceeding.","012/16, 013/16",Huntly

",2 Mar 2014,26 Mar 2015,14-102,"In the early hours of 2 March 2014, a diesel-hauled, four-carriage passenger train had completed passenger operations for the night and was returning empty from Waitakere for overnight stabling in the yard in Otahuhu, near Westfield. There were the train driver and one train manager on board. At 0142 a train controller in KiwiRail's national train control centre located in Wellington selected a path at the Westfield points ahead of the train to cross it from the Down Main line on which it was travelling to the adjacent Up Main line. He did this in order to co-ordinate several other empty passenger trains that were also returning to the Otahuhu yard for overnight stabling. At the time the path was selected, the train was still about three kilometres from the first of three trackside signals and one route indicator, which indicated that the train was to be routed through a slow-speed crossover. However, the train driver did not slow his train in compliance with the signals and route indicator. The locomotive derailed and rolled on to its side as it travelled through the crossover at 71 kilometres per hour, 46 kilometres per hour faster than the maximum allowable speed. The leading two passenger carriages derailed but remained upright. The trailing two passenger carriages remained on the track. The train driver and train manager received minor injuries. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the train driver's performance was possibly affected by his being tired at the end of a nine-hour shift in the early hours of the morning, but fatigue was unlikely to have been a factor. The Commission identified two safety issues: there was no defence in the system to prevent an accident if a train driver did not react correctly to signals and route indicators; KiwiRail's current policy and procedures regarding information that train controllers should give to train drivers about the routes set for their trains and other factors that are likely to affect the trains’ progress are unclear and not consistent with protocols for good communication and crew resource management. The Commission has an open recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to develop a national standard for rail participants that deals with the protocols for good communication and crew resource management. The Commission is recommending that KiwiRail provide guidance to train controllers on the practice of passing to train drivers additional information about route setting or any other unusual factors that are likely to affect the progress of or the manner in which they drive their trains. The key lesson learnt from the inquiry into this occurrence was that: train drivers should always remain vigilant and comply with the trackside signals. They should always be aware that the paths set for their trains can be altered unexpectedly and may not follow the usual paths.",004/15,Auckland

The concrete block split and the terminal pole for the overhead power line, mounted directly behind the stop block, was severed at ground level. The overhead contact wire drooped and momentarily touched the roof of the train, causing the electrical circuit breaker to trip for the area. The train was extensively damaged and two passengers received minor injuries. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that for both accidents dew forming on the railway track following a period of dry weather made the track slippery (referred to as low adhesion). Both trains were being driven normally but the drivers were caught unaware by the slippery track conditions. The Commission also found that the training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag train type to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems. The computer-controlled train braking system is sophisticated and is fitted with two independent wheel-slide protection systems to manage braking in slippery conditions. Post-accident testing revealed that the braking systems had not been optimised for slippery track conditions when the trains were first commissioned into service. The Commission identified a safety issue whereby the current National Rail System Standards did not require new train types to have their train brake systems tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard. The Commission also identified safety issues with the assessment of risk for trains entering terminating stations. The normal allowable train speeds left little margin for error in the event of something going wrong, and the stop block was an older type and was less effective at absorbing impact forces than its modern equivalent. Also, the pole supporting the overhead electrical traction line was directly in the path of an overrunning train. It was of concern to the Commission that the driver of the train in the second accident was found to have cannabis in his system, although it does not believe that it was a contributory factor. The Commission made four urgent recommendations to KiwiRail to address issues to do with risk, and two further recommendations to the NZ Transport Agency to ensure that low-adhesion braking requirements were defined in rail standards and that the brake systems on the new Auckland electric trains were optimised for low-adhesion conditions. Actions were taken to address four of the recommendations, which were then closed before this report was published. The agencies involved have also made progress in addressing the remaining recommendations, and taken safety actions to address other safety issues identified in this report. Detail of the safety actions taken are included in sections six and seven of this report. In summary, they are: The train brakes were tested and optimised for slippery track conditions; The line speed into Melling Station was reduced and the line speed at other terminal stations was reviewed and changed as appropriate; The stop block at Melling was replaced with a shock absorbing buffer stop; The traction power pole at Melling was relocated away from the track centreline; Matangi drivers received further training on the Matangi brake systems; Overhead traction power reset procedures were changed; A low adhesion working group was formed for the Wellington area; The procurement of a driver training simulator for Matangi trains was initiated; The driving console in the Matangi trains was modified to alert the driver whenever the train was experiencing wheelslide activity. Key lessons arising from this inquiry were: Slippery track conditions are a foreseeable risk and train braking systems must be designed, tested and optimised to provide adequate braking performance under those condition; Train drivers must be adequately trained to be fully conversant with the characteristics of their train braking systems, and to drive their trains within the trains' capabilities; When a new train type is being commissioned and first entered into service, train operators should seek feedback from the drivers on train performance in order to identify and remedy promptly any potential performance issues.","019/14, 005/15, 006/15, 018/14, 020/14, 021/14",Melling
RO-2014-104,"Express freight train striking hi-rail excavator within a protected work area, Raurimu Spiral, North Island Main Trunk line, 17 June 2014
",17 Jun 2014,8 Dec 2016,14-104,"On 17 June 2014 a track maintenance work area had been established between National Park and Raurimu on the North Island Main Trunk line. Part of the work involved the use of an excavator designed to operate on the rails. Prior to the work group starting work, two trains were scheduled to pass through the area. The first train passed through without incident. The rail protection officer who was in charge of site safety and protection authorised the second train to pass through the area. Meanwhile, unbeknown to the rail protection officer, the excavator driver had driven his excavator onto the track to start work. The train passed the main work group and rounded a curve in the track. The train driver saw the excavator on the track ahead and applied emergency braking, but was unable to stop his train colliding with the excavator. The excavator was significantly damaged in the collision and the driver was critically injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the train was authorised to travel through the work area, but the excavator was not authorised to occupy the track. The excavator driver, working under KiwiRail supervision, likely thought he was authorised to occupy the track because he had misinterpreted a 'thumbs up' signal to mean that work was about to begin, and because he had not been fully briefed on the work plan for the day. The Commission also found that non-compliance with KiwiRail standard operating procedures for the planning, the establishment and the running of the protected work area was a factor that contributed to the accident. The key lessons identified from the inquiry into this occurrence are: workers with safety-critical roles can be placed in unsafe situations when standard operating procedures are not followed; seatbelts are known to prevent injuries in vehicle accidents and should always be worn where fitted.",NA,National Park
RO-2014-105,"Near collision between train and hi-rail excavator, Wairarapa Line near Featherston, 11 August 2014",11 Aug 2014,27 Jul 2017,14-105,"At 2230 on Friday 8 August 2014, a worksite was established between Dalefield and Featherston on the Wairarapa Line to enable rail sleepers to be replaced on two rail bridges. Work was scheduled for the whole weekend, with the line to re-open at 0300 on Monday 11 August 2014. Protection for the work area was achieved by train control issuing a track warrant to the rail protection officer, the person responsible for the safety and protection of personnel at the worksite. Trains were not scheduled, and not permitted to travel, through the worksite for the period to which the track warrant applied. The rail protection officer did not remain at the site for the entire period. He travelled between his home in Wellington and the worksite several times throughout the weekend. He was not on site at 0300 on Monday 11 August when the track warrant was due to be cancelled. Instead he had instructed the leading hand for each of the work groups at the two bridges to phone him and report when their work group had completed the work and was clear of the track. The rail protection officer received the all-clear from one of the leading hands, but the other work group had not completed the work. He was unable to make contact with the other leading hand, so he assumed they were clear of the track and cancelled the track warrant with train control. Train control then issued a track warrant for an empty passenger train to pass through the area. The driver of the train noticed the flashing light of a hi-rail excavator working on the rail bridge ahead and stopped his train about 180 metres short of the hi-rail excavator and the work group that was occupying the track. There was no collision and nobody was injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that a near collision between the train and the hi-rail excavator occurred because the rail protection officer informed train control that the worksite was clear without first checking positively that it was. The Commission found that the KiwiRail process for planning and authorising the worksite was not entirely followed and that this contributed to the incident. The planning process did not address how rail activities within and through the protected work area would be controlled during the 52.5-hour work period. The Commission also found that it was likely that the rail protection officer was affected by an underlying level of fatigue and sleep inertia when he made the incorrect assumption that the work had been completed and that the track was safe for trains to pass over. KiwiRail was not effectively managing the rail protection officer's day-to-day workload. The Commission recommended that KiwiRail review the company's Fitness for Work Policy to ensure that the workloads of personnel undertaking safety-critical work, including staff not on a roster, are managed effectively and that the risk of staff suffering from the effects of fatigue is mitigated. Key lessons arising from this inquiry are: not following standard railway operating procedures that are designed to provide for safe railway operations is highly likely to result in an accident; decisions that can affect the safety of railway workers should never be based entirely on assumptions, as in this case when clearance was given for trains to pass through the area when workers were still occupying the track.

RO-2015-101,"Pedestrian fatality, Morningside Drive pedestrian level crossing, West Auckland, 29 January 2015
",29 Jan 2015,22 Sep 2016,15-101,"Morningside Station in Auckland consists of an 'island platform' where the northbound and southbound rail tracks pass either side of the platform. At one end of the platform pedestrians have to walk down a fenced ramp to join a pedestrian level crossing, which is part of the Morningside Drive road level crossing. At the bottom of the platform ramp pedestrians have to turn either left or right to cross the relevant rail track. At 1840 on 29 January 2015, a person alighted from a passenger train at Morningside Station. The person walked alone along the station platform to an electronic fare-payment device, where he recorded the end of his journey. The train from which he had just alighted departed the station. Meanwhile, another train travelling in the opposite direction was approaching the station on the other track. The person walked down the platform ramp and turned right, passing through an unguarded opening, and stepped out in front of the approaching train. The train struck the person, who was fatally injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the train was being driven at below the maximum line speed and that the barriers and warning devices for the adjacent Morningside Drive road level crossing were working correctly. However, there was insufficient protection at the bottom of the platform ramp to prevent pedestrians inadvertently walking out in front of trains. The Commission also found that it was very likely that the pedestrian was distracted by the use of his mobile phone when he stepped out in front of the train. Early in the inquiry the Commission made three urgent recommendations to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to liaise with the relevant parties to: upgrade the protection arrangements for pedestrians exiting the station platform onto the pedestrian level crossing at Morningside Station; clarify who is responsible for controlling and protecting pedestrians as they cross the boundaries between railway stations and the rail corridor in the Auckland metro network; review all pedestrian level crossings in the Auckland metro network and ensure that they have a level of protection commensurate with the level of risk currently and in the immediate future. A fourth recommendation was subsequently made to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that he liaise with KiwiRail New Zealand Limited and road controlling authorities to address the safety issue whereby currently many pedestrian level crossings located in provincial areas do not meet the guidelines laid down by the NZ Transport Agency. A key lesson arising from the inquiry relates to the use of mobile devices by pedestrians, which has been found to make them less aware of hazards around them. Rail operators and providers of rail infrastructure must factor this into their risk assessments when designing safety into rail infrastructure.",,Morningside
RO-2015-102,"Electric locomotive fire at Palmerston North Terminal, 24 November 2015
",24 Nov 2015,13 Apr 2017,15-102,"On Tuesday 24 November 2015 at about 1830, a KiwiRail Holdings Limited (KiwiRail) light freight locomotive (EF30157) caught fire while parked at the Palmerston North rail depot. The Fire Service attended, but the fire was not extinguished until later that evening at 2023. The locomotive's transformer compartment suffered fire damage. No-one was injured during the incident. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the seat of the fire was located where the high-voltage cable, used to transmit power from the overhead power line to the locomotive, was connected into the transformer using a plug and socket arrangement. The socket was filled with oil to insulate the high-voltage cable plug. The cause of the fire was attributed to a failure in the insulation of the high-voltage cable plug. A subsequent short circuit caused an explosion in the oil-filled socket and ignited the oil. The resulting fire was fed by a constant supply of oil from a 3,000-litre reservoir that could not be isolated due to the maintenance shut-off valve's close proximity to the seat of the fire. The Commission found that: no fire detection and suppression system standards have been adopted across the New Zealand rail sector; the operator of the locomotive relied on its staff to apply best judgement when dealing with fires rather than providing specific documentation and training; from the maintenance records available it was not possible to determine if the failed cable was new or second-hand; the 5,000-volt insulation integrity test carried out on the high-voltage cable assembly was not representative of the 25,000-volt in-service conditions. The Commission is recommending that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency: ensure that in their safety cases the access provider of, and operators using, the National Rail System consider fire in rail vehicles as a risk to the safety of their operations, and must demonstrate that they have mitigated that risk as far as reasonably practicable; when conducting safety assessments of each rail licence holder, ensure that they have identified and assessed the risk of fire in a rail vehicle. The Chief Executive should ensure that they have, as far as reasonably practicable, minimised the risk and have measures in place to deal with the outbreak of, and reactions to, fire events; when conducting safety assessments of each rail licence holder operating on the National Rail System, ensure that systems are in place that record in detail the maintenance history of safety-critical rail vehicle parts and that any tests on replacement parts are appropriate to simulate in-service conditions. The Commission is also recommending that the National Rail System Executive adopt or develop a New Zealand Fire Standard that incorporates, but is not limited to: minimising sources of fire ignition; restricting fire propagation; the use of fire-resistant materials; of appropriate firefighting equipment; ventilation systems to protect crew and passengers from harmful smoke and gases; the installation of fixed fire protection systems; the ability to self-rescue or relocate the train in the event of a fire in a tunnel or similar hazardous location. A key lesson identified from this inquiry is that operators of public mass transport systems must provide their staff with guidelines, procedures and training to enable them to deal effectively with a fire, instead of relying on their best judgement.","001/17, 002/17, 003/17, 004/17",Palmerston North
RO-2015-103,"Track occupation irregularity, leading to near collision, Between Manunui and Taumarunui, 15 December 2015
",15 Dec 2015,14 Sep 2017,15-103,"On 15 December 2015 track maintenance workers were replacing sleepers on Bridge 197 between Manunui and Taumarunui on the North Island Main Trunk line. The worksite was protected by compulsory stop boards, where trains were required to stop and get authority from a rail protection officer before passing through the worksite. In this case the rail protection officer was also the team leader responsible for the project. During the morning four freight trains passed through the worksite without incident. The workers were already clear of the worksite when a fifth (passenger) train stopped at the stop boards and requested permission to pass through the worksite. The rail protection officer authorised the passenger train to pass through the worksite. He then engaged in a radio conversation with the train controller, left his work vehicle and 'locked on' to let the workers know it was clear to occupy the track. Despite some of the workers knowing that a passenger train was supposed to be due through the worksite, all of them 'locked on' and occupied the bridge ahead of the approaching train. When the train came into sight, the train driver saw the workers on the bridge ahead and stopped his train 72 metres short of the bridge. There was no collision and no-one was injured. The Commission found that the rail protection officer's error was highly likely a lapse in memory influenced by the pressures he was under in his role as team leader. The Commission also found that the rail protection officer's error should have been identified by others in the work group, and they should have intervened to prevent the incident. The Commission identified three safety issues: that the KiwiRail system allowed the team leader, with all of the tasks and responsibilities associated with that role, to take on the safety-critical role of rail protection officer; the poor standard of non-technical skills among all the workers who were on-site; the rail protection officer's positive post-incident test result for methamphetamine. KiwiRail has been taking safety action to address two of the safety issues. The Commission has made one recommendation to KiwiRail to address the third safety issue. The key lessons identified from the inquiry were: workers responsible for the safety and wellbeing of track staff should not be allowed to be burdened with tasks and responsibilities that will detract from that role; the use of good non-technical skills could have prevented this incident. All operational staff need to be trained and well practised in those skills to prevent one-person errors resulting in accidents and incidents; it is not acceptable under any circumstances for workers to be affected by performance-impairing substances, regardless of what roles they are performing.",023/17,Taumarunui
RO-2016-101,"Signal passed at danger leading to near collision, Wellington Railway Station, 28 May 2016
",28 May 2016,1 Feb 2018,16-101,"Shortly after midnight on Saturday 28 May 2016, an empty passenger train was being moved from Platform 7 at Wellington Railway Station (Wellington Station) to the West Storage Yard for overnight storage. At about the same time a passenger train with 79 passengers on board departed from Platform 5 bound for Upper Hutt. Their respective routes would cross within a short distance from the platforms. It was dark and raining. The signal box controller had set a clear (Green) route for the Upper Hutt train and had set a Red Stop signal to hold the empty train just short of the cross-over point until the Upper Hutt train had cleared that section of track. However, there was another signal showing Green, adjacent to the Red signal meant for the empty train. The driver confused the two signals, and thinking the Green signal was meant for his train, he continued past the Red signal towards the cross-over point. The driver realised his mistake just as his driving cab passed between the Red and Green signals and immediately stopped his train just 12 metres short of the cross-over point. The Upper Hutt train passed through the cross-over 13 seconds later. Both trains were restricted to a maximum speed of 20 kilometres per hour. There was no collision and nobody was injured. Noting that train drivers failing to stop their trains at Red signals is a known and foreseeable risk, the Commission found that there should have been more checks or defences built into the system to prevent this near collision when the driver confused the two signals. The Commission also found that due to the geographically constrained and congested nature of the Wellington Station area, there are fewer fail-safe back-up systems than would normally be associated with a modern track and signalling system. Consequently, there is an elevated risk of trains colliding in the area that will need to be managed now and in future. Safety issues identified during the inquiry included: the heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested; a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station. These include the provision of providing better recognition of signals, standard procedures for signalling trains through the area, and better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains. The Commission refers to a previous recommendation to address issues with communication, (refer to Related Links) and makes two new recommendations to address immediate and long-term solutions for managing the risk in the Wellington Station area. Key safety lessons arising from this incident are that: all safety-critical systems should have checks and defences designed into them that mitigate against human error resulting in incidents or accidents; there should be sufficient clear and concise communication between persons responsible for controlling trains and train drivers so that all parties are aware of the situation and alert to any threats to safe train operations.","033/17, 034/17",Wellington
RO-2016-102,"Train 140 passed Signal 10R at 'Stop' Mission Bush Branch line, Paerata, 25 October 2016
",25 Oct 2016,29 Sep 2017,16-102,"On 25 October 2016, a fully loaded coal train had routed from the North Island Main Trunk line to a steep climb on the Mission Bush Branch line at Paerata. The train suffered from wheelslip and stalled about 1.5 kilometres into the climb. The train driver radioed train control for assistance. Train control arranged for a Mission Bush-based pilot to guide the train as it reversed (set back) to Paerata, to attain more speed for a second attempt at the climb. To set back to Paerata the train had to pass two signals. Both of these signals were displaying red ('Stop') to protect another train that was passing through Paerata on the North Island Main Trunk line. Both the pilot and the driver believed that the train controller had set these two signals to green for their train to set back to Paerata. The train driver was driving from the locomotive at the front of the reversing train, from where he was unable to see the first of the two signals. The pilot was positioned further down the track behind the train, from where he too was unable to see the first signal. The train then reversed past the signal at 'Stop'. The pilot then saw that the second signal near Paerata was displaying red and radioed the driver to stop the train. The train stopped with its rear-most wagon about 420 metres short of Signal 6RA and the North Island Main Trunk line. The other train passed through Paerata just as the train came to a stop. The potential for a collision between the two trains was high. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) found that the train controller did not follow the KiwiRail procedures for reversing a stalled train, which contributed to the incident. It also found that neither the train controller, nor the train driver, nor the pilot was familiar with the correct procedure for setting back a stalled train at Paerata. The Commission identified four safety issues: the setback movement was not planned and carried out in accordance with the operating rules and procedures; KiwiRail had not communicated effectively to staff the replacement of an old procedure for recovering stalled trains at Paerata with the existing Operating Rule 124(d); the train controller, the train driver and the pilot did not have a shared understanding of the limit for the setback authority, or of the method of protecting the movement; the train controller was performing a safety-critical role and was directly involved in the incident, yet he was not asked to undergo a post-incident drug and alcohol test. The Commission has made two recommendations to KiwiRail: to review its change management process to ensure that changes in policies, procedures and rules are communicated effectively to staff; and to ensure that all personnel directly involved in an accident and/or operating incident are asked to submit to drug and alcohol testing. Key safety lessons arising from this incident are: it is important that rail participants are familiar with and follow the approved rules and procedures that have been put in place to achieve safe railway operations; it is important that all staff involved in a railway operation have a common understanding of what the plan is and how it will be carried out safely, which is an essential aspect of non-technical skills.","024/17, 025/17",Paerata
RO-2017-101,"Signal Passed at Danger ‘A’ at compulsory stop boards protected worksite, Pongakawa, Bay of Plenty, 7 February 2017
",7 Feb 2017,18 Oct 2018,17-101,"On 7 February 2017 work had begun on replacing a support pile under a rail bridge on a single-line section of track between Mount Maunganui and Kawerau on the East Coast Main Trunk line. Two sets of warning boards had been placed either side of the worksite to alert train drivers to the worksite ahead. A set of compulsory stop boards had been placed 500 metres from either side of the worksite, where train drivers were required to stop and request permission to enter the worksite from the rail protection officer of the maintenance team. At about 1000 a freight train was en route from Mount Maunganui to Kawerau. The driver was nearing the end of a 10½-hour night shift. Later, the driver did not recall seeing any of the warning or compulsory stop boards and only noticed the presence of a hi-rail maintenance vehicle beside the track as the train was approaching the bridge. The driver reduced the train speed to 25 kilometres per hour shortly before crossing the bridge without authorisation. The rail maintenance workers were working under the bridge at the time, about to remove one of the support piles. Nobody was injured and there was no damage to the train or bridge. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found it likely that the driver was experiencing ‘microsleeps’ at the time the train passed the warning and stop boards. The driver was later diagnosed as suffering from a sleep disorder that affects the quality of sleep. Additionally, the driver had had difficulty sleeping the evening prior to the incident due to the hot ambient temperature. The fact that the driver had been awake for more than 10 hours through the night and was nearing the end of the shift was also a factor. The train locomotive was fitted with a global-positioning-based safety system (eProtect) that should have automatically applied the train brakes when the train failed to stop at the compulsory stop boards. The Commission found that this safety defence failed due to an unnoticed error within the device on board this particular locomotive that was preventing it utilising the global positioning system’s location of the worksite. The Commission identified three safety issues: the KiwiRail medical assessment process did not ensure that the employee being assessed completed the online medical questionnaire themselves. There is some evidence that the system could potentially allow managers or others to complete the questionnaire on employees’ behalf; KiwiRail did not have a mature fatigue risk management system to ensure that relevant personnel performed at adequate levels of alertness; the eProtect KMC module on this locomotive had been transmitting error messages for three weeks before the incident, but the activity database was not being monitored for this type of error. KiwiRail took a safety action to address the issue with the eProtect system, and the Commission made two recommendations to KiwiRail to address issues with its medical assessment programme and its fatigue risk management system. Key lessons arising from the inquiry were: train drivers and other shift workers need to ensure that they are medically fit and make appropriate lifestyle choices that will enhance the amount and quality of their sleep, in order to avoid being fatigued or tired while at work; transport operators must ensure that their staff are fully educated on the factors that can cause or contribute to their becoming tired or fatigued while performing safety-critical roles; technological systems need to be fully tested and have undergone full failure mode analysis if they are going to be relied on as safety defences for preventing accidents and incidents.","018/18, 019/18",Pongakawa
RO-2017-102,"Signalling irregularity, Wellington Railway Station, 3 April 2017
",3 Apr 2017,14 Jun 2018,17-102,"During the morning peak period on 3 April 2017, trains in the Wellington Railway Station yard were being controlled by two signal box operators (signallers) from the Wellington signal box. Signal maintainers were at the time working on a track signalling fault in the area. The signallers were setting the route for a shunt locomotive to recover a set of empty passenger carriages from Platform 9. The signalling fault prompted the signallers to use an alternative route for the shunt locomotive to access Platform 9. However, the route they chose was not physically possible due to the design configuration for some of the crossing points in the area. The signallers were not aware that the route they had set was not possible because the mimic screen they were referring to in the signal box erroneously displayed their chosen route as valid (possible). As a result of the way the points were set, the shunt locomotive was diverted down another section of track into a potential head-on collision with a departing passenger train. The driver of the shunt locomotive realised that his train was routed down the wrong track and stopped his train, but not before it encroached onto the track where the loaded passenger train was heading. Both trains were approaching a red signal that would have required them to stop anyway, but potentially only metres apart. The driver of the passenger train saw the red light, and a train encroaching onto his track ahead, and stopped his train. There was no collision and nobody was injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the error on the mimic screen was the result of an equipment upgrade programme that had overlooked a design aspect of one set of crossing points and had not ensured that the new system was fully representative of the actual track layout. The error with the mimic screen and a missing interlock had gone undetected for many years. The Commission also found that neither of the signallers on duty at the time was aware that they had wrong-routed the shunt locomotive, because they were unaware of the limitations of the crossing points that prevented the shunt locomotive travelling along the chosen route. The Commission also found that the signal box did not have an interlock to prevent the signallers setting a route for the shunt locomotive that was not physically possible due to the design of one of the crossing points. An interlock would have prevented the incident. The Commission identified two key safety issues: the change management process for upgrading the signal box display had not ensured that the mimic screen matched the physical track layout, and had not detected the absence of an interlock to prevent the signallers setting the points to a configuration over which it was not possible for rail traffic to travel; the signallers lacked some familiarity with the physical layout and equipment capabilities in the Wellington yard that they were controlling. The Commission made two recommendations to KiwiRail Limited to address these safety issues. Key lessons arising from this inquiry were: when changes are made to safety-critical systems, the new systems should be fully tested for correct functionality, and the users of the systems should be trained in and familiar with them; personnel controlling the movement of rail traffic should follow procedures rather than make assumptions regarding the status of signalling equipment.","010/18, 011/18",Wellington

The driver thought there was an issue with the train brakes, so stopped the train within the approaches to Wellington Station. After a discussion with maintenance staff, it was decided to return the train to Wellington Station. The train was under the control of a signal box operator (signaller). The signaller referred to the mimic screen and noted that it was showing the train occupying a single section of track between Signals 37 and 39. However, the rear of the train had not quite passed Signal 39. It had cleared an insulated joint in the rail that marked the end of one section and the start of the next on the signaller’s mimic screen, but the insulated joint was eight metres away from the actual signal. The rear of the train had come to rest between the insulated joint and the actual signal. The signaller planned to use Signal 39 to hold the train until another inbound train was clear. However, when the driver changed driving ends, Signal 39 was just behind the driving cab. When the signaller authorised the driver to proceed back to Signal 39, the driver moved the train forward in search of the signal, towards the same set of crossover points as the other inbound train. No sooner had the train begun moving than it crossed back over the insulated joint in the rail. The signaller saw on the mimic screen that the train had passed Signal 39 and was heading towards the inbound train. The signaller called the driver to stop the train. The train stopped about 120 metres past the red signal. There was no collision and nobody was injured. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the situation was created because the signalling system was giving information to the signaller that did not match what was happening in the field. The eight-metre separation between the signal and the insulated joint had not been identified as an issue when the lines in the area were modified and upgraded in 2010. The Commission identified two safety issues that had been identified in a previous inquiry: there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested; a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station. The issues were also relevant to this inquiry. As recommendations had already been made to address the safety issues, no new recommendations have been made. The key safety lesson arising from this accident is that trains should not be unnecessarily authorised to proceed up to red signals in congested areas, because the reduced safety margins in these areas increase the risk of a collision if a signal is passed at danger.",NA,Wellington

",18 Sep 2017,21 Mar 2019,17-104,"At about 1638 on Sunday 17 September 2017, an Auckland metropolitan passenger train was travelling eastbound from Swanson to Britomart Transport Centre with a train driver, a train manager and about 40 passengers on board. As the train approached Baldwin Avenue Station, a group of people on the station platform wearing masks disabled the train by pulling the emergency door release levers on the outside of the train. The group then spray-painted one side of the train before escaping along the rail corridor. The train doors remained closed throughout the event and the passengers were kept on board. Nobody was injured and damage was confined to spray-painting one side of the train. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the design and installation of the emergency door release levers on the Auckland metropolitan trains met the recommended industry standards, and found that the design achieved an appropriate balance between deterring unauthorised use and allowing the doors to be opened from outside the passenger cars. The Commission also found that the emergency response to the incident was appropriate for the circumstances based on the information that was reported. The response to the incident would likely have been more efficient if the train crew involved had spoken directly with the Police communications centre. The Commission identified one safety issue: Transdev Auckland Limited had no policies or procedures in place to guide its train crew in responding to unusual situations. The Commission recommended that Transdev Auckland Limited improve the quality of training for train crews, including training on liaising with emergency services, so that they are better prepared to respond to unusual situations. A key lesson arising from the inquiry is that in any emergency situation, it is important that clear, concise and timely information be given to first responders so that a fast and efficient response can be planned and executed.",001/19,Baldwin
RO-2017-105,"Collision between freight Train 353 and heavy motor vehicle, Lambert Road level crossing, near Kawerau, 6 October 2017
",6 Oct 2017,14 Feb 2019,17-105,"Shortly before midday on Friday 6 October 2017, a Waste Management NZ Limited truck was servicing domestic waste bins along the no-exit Lambert Road, near Kawerau. There was a railway level crossing where the Murupara Branch railway line crossed Lambert Road. The level crossing was protected by stop signs, which required all road users to stop and look for trains before proceeding over the crossing. The truck had reached the end of Lambert Road and turned around, and was stopping periodically to service bins on the other side of the road. When the truck entered the level crossing it was struck by an empty log train that was travelling from Kawerau towards Murupara. The train struck the left side of the truck at a speed of about 63 kilometres per hour. The truck driver was thrown clear of the truck and was fatally injured. The truck was significantly damaged. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that it was very likely the truck did not stop and was travelling at about 48 kilometres per hour as it entered the level crossing. There were no technical issues found with the truck that could have contributed to the accident. The Commission found no issues with the manner in which the train was being driven that could have contributed to the accident, and the level crossing was well signposted in accordance with the required rail and road standards. Notwithstanding the likelihood that the truck did not stop, the Commission found that even if it had, the driver would not have had sufficient view lines for the truck to clear the level crossing from a stop if a train had been just out of view. The Commission also found that the legislation needs to be clearer on the allocation of responsibility between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail users and road users at public road level crossings. The Commission identified two safety issues: the legislation is not clear on the allocation of responsibility between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of road and rail users at public road level crossings; sighting distances for road users at level crossings are one of the factors used to determine the appropriate level of protection required, yet the growth in vegetation around railway level crossings can change sighting distances3 in a relatively short time and render the level crossings unsafe. The Commission made two recommendations to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency, one recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail Holdings Limited and one recommendation to the Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand to address these issues. The key lessons identified arising from the inquiry into this occurrence are: road users must always approach railway level crossings with extreme care, particularly those level crossings that have passive protection only in the form of Give Way or Stop signage; wearing seatbelts will increase the chances of people surviving accidents.","031/18, 032/18, 033/18, 034/18",Kawerau
RO-2017-106,"Mainline locomotives, Wrong-routing and collision with work vehicle, Invercargill, 16 November 2017
",16 Nov 2017,14 Mar 2019,17-106,"At 1503 on Thursday 16 November 2017, two coupled mainline locomotives were being moved from the main line to a refuelling area at Invercargill. However, the points were not set for the intended route and the locomotives were instead diverted into the rail maintenance depot. The locomotives collided with a truck that was parked outside the maintenance depot, propelling it into a freight wagon that was parked inside the depot for repair work. Both ends of the truck were damaged, but nobody was injured. A protective derailing device had been placed onto the rail outside the maintenance depot. The device was designed to derail any rail vehicle inadvertently entering the track that led to the depot. However, the cowcatcher on the front of the lead locomotive dislodged the derailer and prevented it derailing the locomotive. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the locomotives were wrong-routed off the intended route and into the  maintenance depot siding because the necessary checks to ensure that the points were set in the correct position for the movement were not made. The Commission also found that the procedures in the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan for protecting the maintenance depot from unintended rail movements did not conform fully with the KiwiRail rules, and that there were indications that staff were routinely not complying with the procedures set out in the plan. The level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan was not robust in detecting and addressing compliance issues within the Invercargill yard. The Commission identified one safety issue – that the level of audit and compliance testing of the Invercargill Joint Operating Plan was not robust in detecting and addressing compliance issues within the Invercargill yard. KiwiRail Holdings Limited took a number of safety actions to address this safety issue. Consequently, the Commission has made no recommendations arising from this inquiry. Key lessons arising from this inquiry include: it is important to ensure that documented rules, policies and procedures are compatible and consistent across all places of work in the rail network; a culture of non-compliance can quickly develop if staff are not prompted to follow the proper procedures when undertaking their duties, and do not challenge their work colleagues if they observe them not following procedures.",NA,Invercargill
RO-2018-101,"Metropolitan passenger train, derailment, Britomart Transport Centre, Auckland, 9 May 2018
",9 May 2018,3 Oct 2019,18-101,"At about 0935 on 9 May 2018, an Auckland metropolitan passenger train was approaching Britomart Station with about 130 passengers on board. The train was travelling at 24.7 kilometres per hour, which was below the maximum authorised line speed of 25 kilometres per hour, as it passed through a set of rail points that was supposed to divert the train to berth at platform 1. However, a section of rail within the set of points had fractured, which caused the leading passenger car to derail. The train came to rest upright, but only centimetres from a concrete wall dividing the station platforms. Nobody was injured, but there was moderate damage to the train and the track. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the first response to rescue passengers and crew from the derailed train was conducted appropriately and in accordance with the operator’s procedures. The Commission found that the rail from which the rail points had been manufactured met the required specifications. The fracture had initiated at a machining defect on the foot of the rail, which was introduced during the procedure for manufacturing the set of points. The defect likely resulted in a significant to severe reduction in the fatigue and fracture resistance of the rail. The Commission found no evidence that the manufacturing defect was representative of a wider quality issue. The Commission did not identify any safety issues or key lessons, and therefore made no new recommendations.",NA,Britomart
RO-2018-102,"Freight train SPAD and wrong routing, Taimate, 1 October 2018
",1 Oct 2018,19 Dec 2019,18-102,"What happened On 1 October 2018, three track maintenance groups were repairing the track in the area between Seddon and Ward. At the end of the shift one of the work groups parked three heavy track maintenance rail vehicles in the crossing loop at Taimate. There was a set of rail points coming off the adjacent main line at each end of the loop. The points were supposed to have been isolated and manually set for the main line to prevent trains travelling on the main line entering the loop and colliding with the mobile track maintenance vehicles. Later that evening a freight train passing through Taimate on the main line was diverted into the loop at a speed of about 20 km/h. The freight train driver at the last moment noticed the points were set to divert the train into the loop. The driver applied emergency braking but was unable to stop the train before it had travelled some 80 metres into the loop line towards the parked maintenance vehicles. There was no collision and nobody was injured. Why it happened The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the freight train was wrong-routed into the crossing loop because a staff member had inadvertently left the points in the wrong position, and there was no independent verification to confirm that the required protection had been put in place. A SPAD (signal passed at danger) occurred when the driver slowed the train rather than stopping at the Red signal. This was likely due to a confirmation bias that the points were correctly set. Confirmation bias is a common human factor where individuals interpret information in a way that affirms a prior belief. Had the train stopped at the Red signal, it was likely that the driver would have noticed the incorrectly set points and stopped the train before it was wrong routed. The Commission also found that a number of procedural errors had been made in the two days prior to the incident that were factors in the incident, and that a better system of check and challenge, and good communication, could have prevented the train being wrong-routed into the loop. The report refers to a previous recommendation the Commission made in an earlier report that is equally applicable to this incident. KiwiRail has taken a number of safety actions that address the issues raised in this report. Therefore, no new recommendations have been made. What we can learn and who may benefit The key lessons arising from this inquiry are: knowledge and strict following of rail operating rules and procedures is key to safe rail operations and will help prevent incidents and accidents; train drivers have an obligation to confirm for themselves that the information they have had from other parties is correct, and drive with caution until the information is confirmed.",NA,Seddon
RO-2019-101,"Safe-working occurrence, Westfield yard, Ōtāhuhu, Auckland, 24 March 2019",24 Mar 2019,7 May 2020,19-101,"At about 1850 on Sunday 24 March 2019, a work group was completing rail track repairs in a protected work area that had been established in KiwiRail’s Westfield yard in Ōtāhuhu, Auckland. The protected work area was in the process of being disestablished before the work party departed from the site. The rail protection officer in charge of the site was approached by a signals technician who was required to carry out work within the protected work area. Unaware of the exact nature of the signals technician’s intended work, the rail protection officer lost situational awareness and allowed the technician into the protected work area without following the requirements prescribed in KiwiRail’s Rail Operating Rules and Procedures. As a result, the signals technician was not considered to be part of the work group and was therefore not accounted for using the lock-on procedure. The technician was still working within the protected work area when, without any prior knowledge, the electronic blocking protection was removed, putting the technician at risk from rail traffic. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that it was very likely that a safe-working incident occurred as a result of the electronic blocking protection being removed at the rail protection officer’s request, while the signals technician was still working on the track. The Commission also found that the rail protection officer’s request to remove electronic blocking was likely due to the rail protection officer and the signals technician not utilising non-technical skills effectively to develop a shared mental model of the work to be undertaken by the signals technician. Had both parties communicated more effectively and agreed a work plan, it is highly likely that the incident could have been avoided. Neither party had a clear understanding of the other’s intentions, nor did each thoroughly question the other. Because the rail protection officer misunderstood the intentions of the signals technician, it was decided that the prescribed procedure was not required to be followed. This was contrary to KiwiRail’s Rail Operating Rules and Procedures and resulted in the omission of a key safety defence that could have prevented the incident occurring. The key lesson arising from the inquiry is that all personnel undertaking safety-critical roles should adhere to the principles of non-technical skills to ensure that they share the same mental models and have a clear understanding of what is required of themselves and others to complete the tasks safely. Rail operators and all safety-critical workers may benefit from the key lessons of this inquiry.",NA,Westfield
RO-2019-102,"Clinton derailment, 29 March 2019
",29 Mar 2019,9 Apr 2020,19-102,"On 29 March 2019, the three rear wagons of a KiwiRail Holdings Limited freight train derailed as the train exited a crossing loop at Clinton en route from Invercargill to Dunedin. Two of the three derailed wagons overturned onto their sides, causing damage to the wagons, track and a signal. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the freight train had exceeded the maximum permissible track speed when exiting the crossing loop due to the driver becoming distracted and the downhill gradient of the track allowing the train to accelerate to above the maximum permissible line speed. The Commission also found that a phenomenon known as dynamic interaction was very likely the cause of the derailment, where the excessive speed combined with the track geometry at the point of derailment and the centre of gravity of the fully loaded coal wagons caused the wagon to oscillate from side to side. One or more wheels then lifted and climbed the rail, resulting in derailment. The wagon condition and loading were found to be within KiwiRail’s maximum permissible limits. A similar derailment had occurred at the Clinton crossing loop in 2016, which was not investigated by the Commission. At that time KiwiRail took a number of safety actions after the incident, including speed monitoring and track repair. However, a procedural control measure to ensure that loaded trains did not use the crossing loop was not adopted. As a result of this occurrence, KiwiRail has taken a number of safety actions that address the issues raised in this report. Therefore, no new recommendations have been made. The key lessons arising from this inquiry are: a train driver can become distracted even when carrying out tasks specific to their role which, if poorly timed, can have unintended consequences; to avoid repeat accidents and incidents it is important to learn from previous incidents. This requires a focus on implementing corrective action in accordance with the hierarchy of controls. However, when procedural control measures have been identified they should be implemented, checked and monitored properly to ensure the desired results are achieved.",NA,Clinton
RO-2019-103,"Derailment of Train 626, Palmerston North, 4 April 2019",4 Apr 2019,14 May 2020,19-103,"What happened On Thursday 4 April 2019, Train 626, an express freight train consisting of two locomotives and 37 loaded wagons, was travelling north from Palmerston North to Napier. Because of the imminent arrival of a southbound train, the train controller routed Train 626 (the train) from the yard onto the Palmerston North-Gisborne line via the north arrival/departure road and number 29 crossover points. The train was travelling at the maximum authorised line speed of 25 kilometres per hour when the lead locomotive entered the crossover points. At about the same time, the driver applied more power by selecting power notch five while the train continued to descend the 1-in-120 gradient. The train speed had increased to 32 kilometres per hour when there was a sudden loss of brake pipe pressure. A few seconds later the train’s brakes were applied automatically, indicating to the driver that the train had parted. The driver radioed train control and was told that the traction overhead power line had been brought down. Shortly afterwards the train examiner confirmed that the train had also derailed. Why it happened The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found there was insufficient vertical load on the leading bogie of log-carrying wagon UKN143 to prevent it climbing the outer right-hand curved rail on 29B set of points. The Commission also found that no single factor led to this derailment. Instead, it is very likely that a combination of factors contributed to the wheel climb that resulted in the derailment: the track condition and its alignment; the train travelling above the authorised line speed; the condition of the wagon’s suspension system and its sensitivity to the track conditions; the multiple cyclic track twists before the point of derailment; the high, but within limits, centre of gravity of the loaded log wagon. What we can learn The Commission identified a safety issue where there was no procedure for identifying, evaluating and rectifying track twists of a repetitive cyclic nature. As such, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail Holdings Limited identify cyclic track conditions on the national rail network and develop a standard that prioritises actions to be taken in order to reduce the likelihood of a derailment. Planned and preventive maintenance is a key safety requirement for any transportrelated operation. A train driver must keep the train under control at all times.

RO-2019-104,"Unsafe entry into worksite, Taimate, 5 June 2019",5 Jun 2019,17 Dec 2020,19-104,"What happened On 5 June 2019, planned work was being undertaken to repair derailment damage between Taimate and Wharanui. A protected work area had been established, which contained two adjoining worksites and four separate workgroups. A rail protection officer was responsible for overall safety in the protected work area, and northern and southern site protectors were each responsible for one worksite, with two workgroups in each (see Figure 3). At approximately 0825 a work train arrived at the northern end of the protected work area and the train driver requested permission from the rail protection officer to enter the protected work area. The rail protection officer granted permission and the work train entered the protected work area. It travelled safely through the northern worksite but was unintentionally authorised through the southern worksite by the southern site protector while a hi-rail excavator was still on the track. The hi-rail excavator driver overheard the work train being authorised into the southern worksite and immediately removed the excavator and materials from the track. As a result there was no collision and no-one was injured. Why it happened The daily information bulletin advised that the work train would transit completely through the protected work area before continuing to Wharanui, where it would collect concrete sleepers and then return to the worksite. However, the rail protection officer had misunderstood the work train’s route, believing that it would arrive at the protected work area from the north with loaded wagons of concrete sleepers and commence work once it had entered the protected work area. The rail protection officer very likely instructed both site protectors to leave their workgroups locked on and did not require them to return to the safe place while the work train passed through the protected work area. The instruction to remain locked on was challenged by one of the site protectors, but the challenge was disregarded and the rail protection officer continued with the original plan. As a result, neither of the site protectors locked off their workgroups prior to the work train entering the worksites. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) noted that the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures for protecting worksites and individual workers within workgroups were robust and would have prevented this incident, but were not adhered to on the day of the incident. The Commission identified that the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures provided insufficient guidance on how to manage work trains within worksites, and did not differentiate between a train moving to a point where work needs to take place and a train carrying out its designated work as a work train. As a result, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail undertake a review of the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures to ensure that appropriate guidance is provided for those involved in the operation of work trains. What we can learn Established rules that form part of an operator’s safety management system must be followed to help reduce the risk of harm to workers. Creating local workarounds, or modifications to established rules, can, if they are not properly reviewed and assessed, lead to unintended outcomes. Procedures are established to ensure that tasks are completed safely using standardised approaches that have been tested and proven to work. Following approved procedures rather than relying solely on knowledge gained from previous experiences will help to ensure a reliable, safe and structured process that keeps personnel clear of harm. Supporting these procedures with a proficient use of non-technical skills, such as communication, decision-making and challenge and response, will further help to reduce the likelihood of people making mistakes and likely reduce the chance of accidents occurring.

The train was travelling at 25 kilometres per hour, within Wellington Station limits, when the leading bogie of the ninth wagon derailed while passing over a set of points. The derailed wagon was dragged through six sets of points before the train parted between the ninth and tenth wagons. The train’s vigilance system detected a sudden drop in train pipe pressure and the train brakes were applied automatically, stopping the train 256 metres past the point of derailment. The train driver was not injured. However, there was substantial damage to the rail infrastructure that led to a 21-hour suspension of passenger services into and out of Wellington Station. Why it happened The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found there was an insufficient vertical load on the leading bogie of lightly loaded wagon UKK9599 to prevent it climbing the outer right-hand curved rail on the 21A set of points. The Commission also found that no single factor led to this derailment. Instead, it is very likely that a combination of factors, contributed to the wheel climb that resulted in the derailment: the track alignment was at the limit of the wagon’s ability to negotiate the track safely; track faults identified during routine inspections had been closed out without repair; the long-wheelbase track twist was close to the wagon’s maximum design limit; the wheel flange surface roughness exceeded limits by a factor of nearly four.

",3 Sep 2019,17 Dec 2020,19-106,"What happened At about 1802 on 3 September 2019, the daily TranzAlpine service was approaching Rolleston station on a return journey from Greymouth to Christchurch. The train was incorrectly routed onto the West Main Line. The platform at Rolleston could not be accessed from this track, and two passengers who disembarked walked across the East Main Line without the knowledge of train control. The process of disembarking the two passengers from the train took a matter of seconds to complete. However, they were disembarked onto the ballast between the West and East Main Lines and crossed the East Main Line without any form of blocking protection being established. Why it happened When the train driver and train controller became aware that the train had been routed onto the incorrect line, neither made an attempt to contact the other to discuss the situation and formulate a recovery plan. The decision to disembark the passengers between the tracks was based on the train driver’s own assessment that it was a low-risk operation. It did not include any input from the onboard service manager, who was responsible for passenger safety. KiwiRail has subsequently created a direction to train control using a semi-permanent bulletin to prevent passenger trains being routed to the West Main Line at Rolleston. KiwiRail has also drafted instructions to train crews for the controlled disembarkation of passengers when a platform is not available.

Both train drivers realised what was happening and stopped their trains 31.8 metres apart. There was no collision, and no-one was injured in the incident. However, the passengers on both services were held in their trains for more than an hour and considerable disruption was caused to services into and out of Wellington Railway Station. Why it happened The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the driver of the Melling service was distracted by an overheard radio call and did not stop at the Red–Stop signal as required. The signal was at Red–Stop to prevent unauthorised entry into the section of track occupied by the authorised Waikanae service. The Commission found that there were no additional mitigations in place to prevent a train passing the Red–Stop signal and colliding with another train when the train driver did not react correctly to the signal and stop the train. This safety issue had been previously identified by the Commission in the Commission’s inquiry RO-2016-101, which resulted in recommendation (034/17 – Dec 2017) being issued. [that] KiwiRail conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to further reduce the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer-term solution can be made. This recommendation is still open. Therefore, the Commission has not issued a further recommendation. What we can learn Key areas of the Wellington rail network pose higher risks than others and therefore require more caution and concentration from train drivers.

",10 Feb 2020,24 Feb 2022,20-101,"What happened At about 0730 on Monday 10 February 2020 a truck approached Mulcocks Road level crossing, in the Waimakariri District of Canterbury, heading towards State Highway 71. The flashing lights and bells at the level crossing were activated by the approaching Coastal Pacific passenger train. The truck slowed as it approached but did not completely stop short of the level crossing. Instead, the truck continued to move slowly forward onto the level crossing and into the path of the train. The train driver sounded the train’s horn upon realising the truck was not stopping. This alerted the truck driver but it was too late for them to take avoiding action. The train collided with the driver side of the truck’s cab. The truck driver was fatally injured in the collision. Why it happened The truck driver had very likely recognised the activated flashing lights and bells and had intended to keep the truck stopped short of the level crossing until after the train had passed and it was safe to continue. The truck driver had very likely diverted their attention to some distraction inside the cab while believing the truck to be fully stopped. The truck driver was engaged in an incoming mobile phone call at this time, which may have contributed to them becoming distracted. The truck driver did not keep sufficient pressure on the brake pedal of the automatic-transmission truck, allowing the truck to slowly move forward. Closure of Mulcocks Road level crossing, recommended in a report 18 months prior as a possible risk-reduction measure would virtually certainly have prevented this accident. Fitting half-arm barriers to Mulcocks Road level crossing, a secondary recommendation made in the same report, would very likely have prevented this accident. No formal assessment had been undertaken by Waimakariri District Council or KiwiRail to determine if these recommended measures were ‘reasonably practicable’ to implement, and no process or meaningful guidance existed for such an assessment. KiwiRail have since taken safety action to begin formalising a policy for this, and the Commission has made a recommendation for this policy to consider the most complete risk estimates available.

The track ganger started to place the hi-rail vehicle on the track, and was at the vehicle’s rear, when they heard Train 932’s horn sound and then saw the train approaching head-on. The track ganger attempted to raise the hi-rail vehicle wheels but was unsuccessful and jumped clear of the hi-rail vehicle before it was struck by the train at 1504. The train driver, on realising the hi-rail vehicle was on the track, applied full-service braking and prepared for impact. The train collided with the hi-rail vehicle at a speed of 44 kilometres-per-hour and pushed it 139 metres before coming to a stop. The hi-rail vehicle was extensively damaged and the locomotive sustained minor damage. There were no injuries. Why it happened The track warrant control rules allowed the train controller to issue a track warrant to a hi-rail vehicle operator conditional on the departure of a train from the location of where the track warrant was accepted. The track ganger did not verify that Train 932 had passed before the hi-rail vehicle was placed on the track. The collision speed could have been reduced if the train driver had applied emergency braking rather than full-service braking. What we can learn Issuing track warrants to infrastructure staff, hi-rail vehicles or trolley users that are conditional on the arrival or departure of trains is likely to endanger lives by causing accidents if the track warrant holders fail to confirm train locations. Applying the train brake in its emergency position will achieve a shorter stopping distance than applying it to its full-service position.

RO-2020-103,"Collision between bus and locomotive, Clevely Line level crossing, Bunnythorpe, 16 September 2020",16 Sep 2020,16 Dec 2021,20-103,"What happened At about 0803 on Wednesday 16 September 2020, a bus carrying 31 passengers was on its usual route between Palmerston North and Feilding. Although the service was not a designated school bus, most of the passengers were school children on their way to either one of two local schools. The bus was running a few minutes behind its service schedule as it travelled north along Railway Road, between Palmerston North and Bunnythorpe. It stopped on Railway Road while the driver waited to make a right-hand turn onto Clevely Line. At the same time, locomotive DL9469 was travelling north on the North Island Main Trunk line towards Marton, approaching the Clevely Line level crossing. The locomotive was running 15 minutes ahead of its usual schedule. The Clevely Line level crossing was positioned approximately 15 metres to the east of Railway Road. The level crossing was protected by flashing lights, bells and signage, in accordance with Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency requirements. The approach of locomotive DL9469 towards the Clevely Line level crossing activated the flashing lights and bells. The bus driver waited for a break in road traffic, travelling south, and once there was a gap in the traffic commenced the right-hand turn onto Clevely Line. The bus completed its right-hand turn onto Clevely Line and, for reasons unable to be determined, did not stop before the level crossing. The bus drove onto the level crossing at the same time as the locomotive was passing over it. The front of the bus connected with the rear left-hand quarter of the locomotive, causing the windscreen of the bus to be torn off along with most of the front fairing structure. The bus driver, who was not restrained, was ejected through the front of the bus. The momentum of the bus caused it to continue rolling forward at a low speed. The bus driver received fatal injuries. Why it happened While the reason for the bus driver not stopping could not be determined with certainty, it is likely that they had rarely encountered a train at the level crossing based on the timetables and schedules of the bus and rail operations. This likely led to the bus driver not having any expectation that they would have to stop at the level crossing, and as a result taking some time to acknowledge and then react to the level crossing alarms. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission recommended that Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency review clause 9.5(c) of the Land Transport (Road User) Rule 2004 in consultation with the rail industry to assess its adequacy regarding the risks posed by level crossings in close proximity to road intersections. What we can learn Railway level crossings provide a heightened risk to road users. All road users should check for approaching rail traffic and be prepared to stop regardless of the state of the level crossing protection equipment.

RO-2020-104,"Safe Working Irregularity, East Coast Main Trunk Line, Hamilton Eureka, 21 September 2020
",21 Sep 2020,20 Jan 2022,20-104,"What happened At 0747 on 21 September 2020, a freight train on the East Coast Main Trunk line entered a section of track that the rail protection officer believed was part of a protected work area and which was already occupied by a contractor operating a hi-rail vehicle. The hi-rail vehicle was working under the protection of a rail protection officer who was responsible for organising the safety of the work area. It was intended that the protected work area extend for a distance of about 15 kilometres between Hamilton and Eureka. However, due to a number of miscommunications, Train Control only protected the track between Hamilton and Ruakura for a distance of about 7 kilometres. It resulted in the hi-rail vehicle operator unknowingly working on the track in a section that had not been protected from rail traffic. A collision between the train and the hi-rail vehicle was only avoided because the hi-rail vehicle had voluntarily cleared the track about five minutes earlier. Why it happened While establishing the protected work area, neither the rail protection officer nor the train controller noticed a discrepancy recording the limits of the protected area that they were referencing. The rail protection officer was unfamiliar with the area of operation. The ineffective use of communication skills with erroneous read-backs (hear-back error) while trying to implement an administrative control measure resulted in a designated procedure not being followed correctly and protection arrangements not being put into place. What we can learn The key lessons arising from this inquiry are: Workers on the national rail network are at risk of serious harm if a rail vehicle enters the section of track while they are working. All personnel involved in safety-critical operations should recognise non-technical, and particularly communication, skills as an important risk mitigation measure. The use of engineering control measures may enhance the safety of track workers. Who may benefit? Rail operators (including train controllers), rail protection officers and track maintenance personnel may benefit from the findings in this report.",009/21,Ruakura
RO-2021-101,"Serious injury during shunting operations on board the Aratere, Interislander ferry terminal, Wellington, 9 April 2021
",9 Apr 2021,22 Sep 2022,21-101,"What happened On the evening of 9 April 2021, a remote-control operator operating a remotely controlled shunt locomotive was injured during discharging operations on board the rail ferry Aratere. The remote-control operator was caught between the foot step of the head wagon and the runner wagon while attempting to couple to the wagons. The head wagon was the first of a set of coupled wagons (a rake) located on the starboard outer track of the Aratere’s rail deck. The remote-control operator had made multiple unsuccessful attempts to couple the two wagons. The position of the two wagons on a curved section of the outer starboard track had caused a misalignment of the two couplers. During the final attempt the remote-control operator moved between the two wagons to physically open the knuckle of the couplers, but did not relocate to a safe area before operating the shunt locomotive remotely. Why it happened The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) found that the remote-control operator entered the danger zone (an area in which individuals are exposed to physical risk) to realign an off-centre coupler, but did not reposition clear of the danger zone before they operated the shunt locomotive remotely. The Commission found that the degree of track curvature on the starboard outer track on the Aratere made it difficult to couple wagons positioned on parts of the curve. The Commission found that the risk assessment undertaken to determine the maximum rake length on the outer rails had not adequately mitigated the difficulty involved with coupling wagons positioned on the curved part of a track. What we can learn Shunting rail vehicles is a safety-critical task. Safety-critical tasks should be designed in such a way so as not to cause additional or unnecessary risks for employees. Experiencing difficulties with a procedure can lead to task fixation. This can create an environment conducive to risk-taking activity and error-producing conditions.

RO-2021-102,"Freight Train 391, Collision with light truck Saunders Road, Marton, 13 May 2021",13 May 2021,2 Feb 2023,21-102,"What happened At about 1520 on Thursday 13 May 2021, a two-person team was engaged in road-marking activities at Saunders Road level crossing, some 5 kilometres northeast of Marton. The team consisted of a paint applicator operator (the operator), who was conducting work on the road next to a truck on the south side of the crossing. The operator was assisted by the truck’s driver, who was sitting in the right-hand side of the truck cab in readiness to move when instructed by the operator. The operator was in the process of painting yellow limit lines that designated the safe area for vehicles to stop at the crossing, when they felt the paint hose pulling away from them as it tightened up. The operator looked up to see that the driver had moved the truck and was proceeding towards the north side of the crossing. The operator called out to the driver to stop the truck as the work on the south side was not complete. The driver immediately stopped on the railway track. The operator then noticed a train rounding a bend approximately 260 metres northeast of the crossing. The operator shouted to the driver that a train was coming, but for reasons unable to be determined the driver did not get out of the truck or move it off the crossing. At 1526 the 556-metre-long, 699-tonne train was travelling at 72.7 kilometres per hour when it struck the truck on its right-hand side. The truck driver received fatal injuries. Why it happened Although the crossing markings were within 5 metres of the railway track, a permit to enter had not been sought from the rail access provider (KiwiRail) by the road-marking company, as required by the Railways Act 2005. Had a permit to enter been sought, it is almost certain KiwiRail would have required additional protections to be in place before the commencement of the work. The reason for the driver moving the truck before they were instructed to do so by the operator could not be determined. It is about as likely as not that the driver was watching the operator painting the markings and moved the truck prematurely under the assumption that the operator had finished what they were doing. Safety for pedestrians and vehicles using level crossings is on the Transport Accident Investigation Commission’s (Commission’s) watchlist of serious transport safety concerns. As a result of this accident the Commission has recommended that KiwiRail review its permit-to-enter process by working with road-controlling authorities and those requiring permits to enter to ensure that provision is made for the practicable requirements for non-static and short-term work at multiple locations within the rail corridor. The Commission has recommended that KiwiRail review its permit-to-enter process to ensure that any associated costs and requirements are not prohibitive to the completion of safety-critical work, and that the charging of fees for permits to enter is in accordance with the Railways Act. What we can learn Any work within the rail corridor poses an inherent but manageable risk, even if that work is not railway related. Undertaking this work without the knowledge of the rail access provider, and without appropriate protections for workers (including appropriate risk training), may increase that risk to a dangerous level. Anyone in the vicinity of the rail corridor, whether engaged in work activity or not, should expect rail traffic at any time. Safety-critical communication equipment should be designed and operated in a manner that avoids the potential for misunderstanding. Who may benefit Road users, road-controlling authorities, roading contractors and people involved with the planning and approval of work around road/rail interfaces may all benefit from the findings and recommendations in this report.","018/22, 019/22",Marton

The parting occurred at about 636.9 kilometres (see Site Information paragraph 2.76) between Papakura and Pukekohe on the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT), and caused the brakes to automatically apply in both train portions as air hoses between the carriages separated. There were no injuries, but some damage to inter-carriage electrical jumper cables. The two parted train portions were then recoupled by the train crew, and the train was authorised by train control to continue under a 20 kilometre per hour speed restriction to Pukekohe Station where passengers were disembarked. It is virtually certain that the park brakes on the front two of the train’s four carriages remained engaged during this journey of about 7.5 kilometres. After examination by mechanical staff at Pukekohe, the train continued to Hamilton under an authorised 55 kilometre per hour speed restriction and suffered a second parting, again between its second and third carriages, at about 567.4 kilometres on the NIMT. Why it happened It is virtually certain that the knuckle of the newly fitted coupler at the rear of the second carriage opened due to creep, a phenomenon in automatic knuckle couplers where vibration during running can cause a coupler’s lock to move upwards and the coupler to become unlocked. The incident coupler’s anti-creep mechanism, which would normally limit lock creep below the point of unlocking, was ineffective due to out-of-tolerance tooling used in the casting of its lock. Quality checks performed by the coupler’s United States manufacturer, Amsted, were insufficient to detect this issue at either component or assembly level. Functional testing of anti-creep was relatively new to KiwiRail and was not included as part of the commissioning process when Amsted couplers were fitted to Te Huia carriages. This inexperience also meant that similar couplers fitted to KiwiRail’s freight wagons, found to be failing functional tests, were not identified as having an ineffective anti-creep mechanism. Park brakes were applied as part of the rectification by the train crew carrying out post-recoupling brake tests. The park brakes were not then released, likely due to severed inter-carriage jumper cables causing the trainline control circuit for the park brake release to be inoperable. What we can learn Infrequent sampling after the production of parts allows for larger numbers of defective parts to be produced before defects are detected. Staff responding to train failures require an accurate knowledge of, and training in, key train systems.

RO-2021-104,"Passenger train 6205, train derailment, Kāpiti, 17 August 2021
",17 Aug 2021,25 Oct 2024,21-104,"What happened On 17 August 2021 a Transdev Wellington-based passenger train was operating a scheduled service from Waikanae to Wellington on the North Island Main Trunk line known as the Kāpiti line. At about 0544 the passenger train departed Paekākāriki station in a southerly direction, conveying 82 passengers and three train crew under heavy rainfall conditions. At about 0547 the passenger train, travelling at about 70 kilometres per hour, was rounding a right-hand curve next to the hillside when the train driver sighted a landslide covering both main lines approximately 40 metres in front of the train. The train driver applied the emergency brake, but the train struck the debris from the landslide, derailing three of the four passenger cars before coming to a complete stop. No passengers or crew suffered any injuries, and all were evacuated safely to a nearby location. Why it happened Because of the curvature of the track and the speed of the train, there was only a short sighting distance to the landslide debris across the track. The train driver did not have enough distance or time to stop before reaching the landslide. When the train came across the debris, the debris disengaged the train’s wheel-rail interface, derailing the train. The Kāpiti area had experienced heavy rainfall in the hills adjacent to the rail corridor, which overwhelmed the waterways and drainage systems that would normally have moved water away. The meteorological information provided to KiwiRail predicted rainfall in most places in the North Island, with totals of 25 millimetres or more over a 24-hour period for western areas south of Hamilton and the Bay of Plenty. What we can learn As the frequency of severe weather events increases, risk assessments for transport infrastructure become vital to ensure hazards are identified and appropriate controls are applied. Engineering systems and real-time monitoring can assist with providing those in the transport sector with accurate information from which to make timely and informed safety decisions.

RO-2021-105,"Unintended movement resulting in locomotive and wagon entering Picton Harbour, Picton, 1 September 2021",1 Sep 2021,1 Jun 2023,21-105,"What happened At approximately 1530 on 1 September 2021, a shunt locomotive at the Picton freight yard was in the process of relocating a single wagon. The shunt locomotive was being operated by remote control, with the operator using a remote-control pack attached by a harness to their chest. The remote-controlled shunt locomotive and single attached wagon travelled onto the rail linkspan before entering the harbour at the Picton ferry terminal. It was an unintended shunting movement. At the time of the incident there was no ferry berthed at the wharf and the rail linkspan was not in use. There were no injuries caused by this incident. Why it happened The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) found that the unplanned and unintended remote-controlled movement of the shunt locomotive resulted in it travelling over the rail linkspan and into the harbour. The Commission found that there was no single factor that led to this incident. Instead, it is very likely that a combination of factors contributed to the unintended movement: the remote-control operator was working independently when the incident occurred, when usually they worked as one of a team; when the rail linkspan was not in use it was not protected from rail movements; KiwiRail’s rules were silent on when an operator should deactivate a remote-control operator’s pack to prevent unintended movements. What we can learn Shunting rail vehicles is a safety-critical task. The post-certification support process is a vital component for newly trained staff to receive regular feedback and support on their performance. Those in a two-person shunt team should, where possible, maintain visual contact to help mitigate shunting risks. Periods of busy activity, even if they are not cognitively demanding, can present challenges. Organisations should be mindful of such challenges and ensure workers are well equipped with strategies to manage workflow, and have measures in place to ensure workers are able to remain focused on safety-critical tasks. Who may benefit Rail operators and operational staff involved in shunting procedures may benefit from the key lessons in this report. Any organisations with workers who experience periods of busy activity that include safety-critical tasks may also benefit from this report.","005/23, 004/23",Picton

",13 Dec 2021,4 May 2023,21-106,"What happened At about 2300 on Monday 13 December 2021, a KiwiRail freight train was travelling north between Marton and Hunterville on the North Island Main Trunk line. As the train rounded a left-hand curve, the train driver saw that the field to their right was flooded with water and that the floodwater was crossing the railway track in front of the train. The train driver immediately reduced power to the train as it approached the water and then, suspecting that the train had derailed, applied the train’s brakes. Once the train had stopped, the train driver remained in the locomotive cab to await assistance, as they had seen that the overhead electrical wire was damaged. When assistance arrived, it was discovered that 17 of the train’s 37 wagons and the locomotive had derailed. Why it happened In the days preceding the accident, unseasonal significant rainfall had occurred throughout the country. The Porewa catchment area, which was the closest to the accident site, recorded significant rainfall of 38.5 millimetres in a two-hour period before the accident. This rainfall had led to flooding in the area the train was traversing. The area in which the flooding occurred was not within monitoring or capture distance of the nearest weather stations. Floodwater inundated an area of farmland that had no recent history of flood events. The floodwater removed the ballast formation that was supporting the railway track. The unsupported track moved as the train passed over it, causing the train to derail.

",11 May 2022,23 Nov 2023,22-101,"What happened At about 0602, on 11 May 2022, the Capital Connection express passenger train was at the platform of Palmerston North station when the train manager discovered a fire on board the auxiliary generator wagon . All passenger carriages were immediately evacuated before the doors were closed to prevent re-entry. The train manager contacted Fire and Emergency New Zealand to report the fire and a fire appliance responded. On arrival firefighters observed a small fire in the auxiliary generator wagon, which they extinguished with a carbon dioxide portable fire extinguisher. There were no injuries, and the fire damage was contained to the top box and ceiling of the auxiliary generator wagon. Why it happened The fire was accidental and likely caused by the proximity of the exhaust tail pipe to the internal ceiling lining of the wagon. The likelihood of a fire in the auxiliary generator wagon had increased due to a combination of the following factors: the top box was sealed closed and could not be opened for maintenance inspection; the insulation within the top box was in poor condition with significant soot build-up; the exhaust tail pipe had corroded to the extent that it no longer extended through and above the roof of the auxiliary generator wagon. What we can learn Rail vehicle maintenance must include inspection of all key parts and equipment to minimise the risk of a fire on board a passenger train. Early fire detection systems on trains are vital to ensure any fire is detected at the earliest opportunity before spreading throughout the train.

RO-2022-102,"L71 Mainline Shunt, derailment and subsequent rollover, Tamaki, 1 June 2022
",1 Jun 2022,14 Dec 2023,22-102,"What happened On 31 May 2022, a three-person train crew was transporting freight wagons between the Wiri rail yard and the Port of Auckland on the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) line. The crew consisted of a locomotive engineer (LE), a rail operator who was under training (the trainee) and another rail operator who was supervising the trainee as a minder (the minder). On 1 June 2022, at about 0057, the crew departed the Port of Auckland for their return journey to the Westfield rail terminal following the completion of their scheduled work. Because of planned work on the NIMT, train control set the first part of the route on the bi-directional track back to Westfield using the up mainline in a down direction. The single-cab locomotive was being operated in a long-hood leading configuration, ] which meant that the LE was unable to see the signals when travelling on the up mainline in the down direction. This required the trainee to observe the rail signal indications along the track and report them to the LE. At about 0103 the locomotive, travelling at about 77 kilometres per hour (km/h), entered a track crossover point at Tamaki. As it did so, the locomotive derailed and overturned, coming to rest on its side approximately 55 metres (m) from the point of derailment. The three crew members suffered minor to moderate injuries and evacuated the cab through the broken front windscreen of the locomotive. Why it happened The locomotive was unable to cross from one track to another safely because of its high speed. It was travelling approximately 50 km/h faster than the speed set by the signal indications. The trainee had been tasked to identify and report the signal indications to the LE along the route. Because of the seating arrangement in the locomotive cab while travelling in a long-hood leading configuration, the minder could not confirm that the trainee was interpreting and reporting the signal indications correctly. The trainee incorrectly reported two signal indications to the LE and the LE maintained the speed of the locomotive based on that incorrect information. KiwiRail had not undertaken a risk assessment for operating locomotives in the long-hood leading configuration on the Auckland Metro rail network. As a result, the risks associated with long-hood leading operations had not been adequately managed. What we can learn Operating locomotives in a long-hood leading configuration on the NIMT line poses additional safety risks. When an activity is infrequent or different from normal operations, a risk assessment should occur, and a risk management plan put in place. On-the-job training can introduce additional risks to an operation. Effective supervision of trainees undertaking safety-critical tasks is an important defence against unsafe activity. Fitness for duty is an important risk control measure that ensures individuals can focus on the task at hand. Distractions in the form of injuries, illnesses or stresses outside work can impact the ability to concentrate and can impair cognitive performance.1F Crew Resource Management (CRM) is an important tool that enables individuals to work together effectively, particularly when operating in unusual or non-normal circumstances. CRM requires the use of all available resources; communication should include all parties who have relevant operational safety information to share. Complex systems require robust engineering-risk controls to guard against variable human performance within the system. Administrative controls, which are vulnerable to human error and non-compliance, should not solely be relied upon to keep a system safe. Regulatory oversight is an integral part of any transport safety system. Independent assurance that an operator is appropriately managing their safety-critical risks provides a fundamental layer of defence against the introduction of unsafe operational practices. Who may benefit Rail personnel, transport operators and anyone involved in safety assessments may benefit from the findings in this report.","034/23, 035/23, 036/23, 037/23, 038/23",Tamaki

",8 Aug 2022,19 Oct 2023,22-103,"What happened On Saturday 6 August 2022, train control (based in Wellington) became aware of a signalling fault in the Christchurch area. Level crossing alarms at three different locations had defaulted to ‘fail-safe mode’, meaning that warning lights, bells and barrier arms were constantly activated. This was causing problems for road traffic in the area. The signals staff who were called out to repair the fault were unable to trace it within their allowable working hours, therefore they disconnected the Selwyn Street level crossing as per standard operating instructions. This allowed road traffic to enter the level crossing without the need for manual operation of the level crossing alarms and barriers. The Selwyn Street level crossing alarm system was disconnected from its power source. The barrier arms were raised and secured. Bags were placed over the alarm lights to show they were out of service. Train control imposed a 10 kilometre per hour speed restriction on any rail traffic approaching Selwyn Street and the other affected level crossings. On Monday 8 August 2022, while the level crossing remained disconnected, a ‘Go Bus’-operated Christchurch Metro passenger bus drove across the Selwyn Street level crossing as a KiwiRail locomotive approached. The bus passed approximately 12 metres in front of the locomotive, creating a ‘near-miss’ situation. There was no collision, no damage and no injuries. Why it happened The signalling cable that controlled the level crossings had been partially cut through. Because of the nature of the partial cut, the location of the fault was not readily apparent to signals staff. This delayed the process of identifying and rectifying the problem. Because the fault occurred on a weekend, limited signals staff were available. When the attending signals staff had worked their allowable hours they left the site after following KiwiRail procedures for disconnecting alarms. KiwiRail’s procedure for disconnecting the level crossing alarms and barriers did not adequately address the risk posed by leaving the level crossing unattended. There was no requirement in KiwiRail’s procedures to inform the road controlling authority that the level crossing was disconnected. As a result, no form of temporary traffic management was put in place until after the near miss between the bus and train was reported. What we can learn Risk assessments and associated mitigations are based on the controls in place at the time of the assessment. Removal of any of these risk controls without reassessment may increase risk to an unacceptable level.

The truck was crossing the level crossing when the train’s refuge wagon collided with the truck’s trailer. The train travelled another 16 metres before it came to a complete stop. The train’s refuge wagon derailed, and the truck’s trailer tipped onto its side. The rail operator was propelled from the refuge wagon and sustained moderate injuries when they fell to the ground. The locomotive engineer and the truck’s two occupants were not injured. Why it happened It is likely that the truck driver saw the train when the truck crossed a preceding level crossing, and perceived that the train was travelling in the opposite direction. It is virtually certain that the truck driver did not expect to see the train approaching the Fertilizer Road level crossing, and consequently did not stop to give way to it. The truck driver was engaged in a phone conversation as they manoeuvred a complex intersection. Given the length of time they had been on duty without taking the required scheduled rest breaks, it is likely that their ability to scan and perceive critical information effectively from the road environment was further reduced by the effects of fatigue. At the time of the accident, KiwiRail had not conducted a risk assessment for propelling wagons to the Fonterra cool store at Port Whangārei. A formal identification of hazards would likely have led to mitigations that reduced the risk of collision accidents between rail and road vehicles at level crossings on this branch line. The train crew did not operate in compliance with the Rail Operating Code as the train approached and entered the level crossing. The Code required the train to be at a lower speed than it was. Consultation and collaboration between KiwiRail and the road controlling authority had been ineffective in addressing the risks of hazardous road-user behaviour. What we can learn Road users must always approach railway level crossings with extreme care, particularly those level crossings that have passive protection. It is essential that rail vehicle operators adhere to local operating instructions, codes and standards, particularly when propelling on branch lines and in sidings. The installation of visual and audible warning devices on all trains with refuge wagons leading would very likely reduce the risk of collisions occurring at level crossings by assisting observers to detect trains and determine their directions of travel.

It then began travelling northwest towards a planned worksite near Apata for an infrastructure team to carry out maintenance work. HRV1 was being driven by the infrastructure team’s supervisor (the Ganger ) and there was one passenger, a track worker (TW1). A second Hi-Rail vehicle (HRV2), driven by another track worker (TW2), on-tracked at the same location two minutes after HRV1 and started travelling in the same direction towards Apata, following HRV1 to the worksite. The Ganger driving HRV1 stopped the truck in the middle of a left-hand curve, approximately 500 metres (m) from the on-tracking location, to mark a section of track that indicated the start of the worksite. Once stopped, the Ganger and TW1 both exited HRV1 and walked to the track in front of the vehicle. The Ganger then spray-painted markings onto the track while TW1 watched what the Ganger was doing. A short time later HRV2, driven by TW2, rounded the left-hand curve behind HRV1 travelling at approximately 38 kilometres per hour (km/h). When TW2 realised that HRV1 was stopped on the track, they attempted to stop by braking heavily. However, HRV2 collided with the rear of HRV1 while travelling at 38 km/h at the same time as TW1 was climbing back into the cab of HRV1. Upon impact TW1 was thrown off HRV1 onto the stone ballast at the side of the track. TW1 suffered bruising to their body and a lacerated finger. Metal cabinets on the rear deck of HRV1 were also shorn off their mountings and became unsecured. Why it happened A radio call made by the Ganger to HRV2 stating that HRV1 was stopped on the track ahead was not received or acknowledged. HRV2 was travelling at a speed that did not reflect the conditions and was contrary to the requirements of KiwiRail’s Rail Operations Rules and Procedures. As well as carrying out the work task, the Ganger was conducting multiple roles including worksite supervisor, team trainer/instructor and rail protection officer. The Ganger was not adequately supported to carry out these roles while simultaneously supervising the safety of a relatively inexperienced team. What we can learn Safety-critical tasks, such as operating HRVs on track, require a high level of focus, behaviour and communication. All rail staff should be aware of the possibility of conflicting rail traffic while working near vehicles stopped on track. Personnel involved with the loading of rail vehicles, including HRVs, should ensure the security of loads before travel to mitigate the consequences of a collision.

On 28 January, the crew of a KiwiRail freight train (train 385) observed and reported to Train Control a high-water level at rail bridge 85 on the East Coast Main Trunk line (ECMT) north of Te Puke. On receipt of the information, Train Control arranged for a track inspection to be conducted to assess the risks. The track inspection occurred at an incorrect location, resulting in clearance being given for trains to resume normal operations. At 0330 the next day, a KiwiRail freight train (train 360) conveying 39 wagons, with the same crew on board who had reported the high water the previous day, departed Kawerau rail terminal bound for Tauranga. At about 0430 the train, travelling at approximately 60 kilometres per hour, encountered substantial floodwater across the track north of Te Puke, not far from rail bridge 85. The crew felt the locomotive drop downwards before the emergency brake activated automatically, stopping the train approximately 150 metres past the floodwater. The crew disembarked to see what had activated the emergency brakes. They discovered that only the first five wagons were behind the locomotive, with the other 34 wagons missing. Of the five wagons behind the locomotive, four had uncoupled. It was later discovered that of those 34 wagons, 11 had derailed approximately 100 metres down the track. The crew reboarded the locomotive and contacted Train Control before moving the locomotive and the one remaining wagon forward to higher ground. Why it happened The Bay of Plenty region had been experiencing heavy rainfall two days prior to the derailment. Rainfall that fell during that period overwhelmed rivers and waterways in and around Te Puke, including the drainage system along the rail corridor. At its peak, the water level around the accident site rose approximately 3.5 metres , causing scouring and washout of the rail track’s supporting formation . Without the supporting formation, the track was not able to support the weight of the train as it passed over the compromised section. This resulted in the decoupling and derailment of some of the wagons. What we can learn As the frequency of severe weather events increases, risk assessments for transport infrastructure become more significant. Therefore, ensuring hazards are identified and appropriate controls are applied is essential. All personnel undertaking safety-critical roles should adhere to the principles underlying the application of non-technical skills to ensure that they share the same mental models and have a clear understanding of what is required of themselves and others to complete tasks safely. Engineering systems and real-time monitoring can assist in providing accurate information with which personnel can make timely and informed decisions and ensure a safe transport system. Who may benefit Rail personnel, transport operators, infrastructure designers, maintainers of the infrastructure and anyone involved in planning and responding to the impacts of weather events on transport networks may benefit from the findings.","012/24, 013/24, 014/24",Te Puke
RO-2023-103,"Safe-working irregularity, 3.85 km mark, Johnsonville line – tunnel 5, 04 May 2023",4 May 2023,21 Mar 2024,23-103,"What happened At 1241 on Thursday 4 May 2023, a team of two KiwiRail track workers entered the rail corridor at Crofton Downs without permission and walked alongside the rail line towards tunnel 5 (the tunnel). On arrival at the northern end of the tunnel one of the track workers contacted train control by telephone and requested time to conduct work on the Johnsonville line (JVL), stating their location to be at the 3.85 kilometre (km) mark north of tunnel 5 and that they wanted to travel on foot through the tunnel to the south end. The tunnel is located between Wadestown and Crofton Downs. The train controller (the TC) went through their usual procedure for allocating track time and putting protection for the track workers in place before the track workers began making their way through the tunnel. However, the required protection from rail traffic, in the form of track signals being held at red (stop), was established by the TC at locations different from where the track workers were intending to work. As there was no protection in place at the correct locations, a Transdev passenger train entered the section of track that the track workers thought was blocked for their work. The two track workers were nearing the southern portal of the tunnel when they became aware of the Transdev passenger train entering the tunnel from the northern end. The track workers were able to exit the tunnel and move to a safe position before the train reached the southern portal. At 1248 the driver of the Transdev passenger train reported unexpectedly sighting the track workers to train control. Why it happened The track workers arrived at the northern entrance to the tunnel without the required permission and without any protection from rail traffic. The TC recorded the intended track occupation on the train control diagram at locations different from those requested by the track worker and applied electronic blocking protection at those incorrect locations. The TC authorised the track occupancy to the track worker over the telephone rather than the radio. The track worker did not identify the location discrepancy while listening to the TC state the protection details and repeated back the incorrect locations without challenge. What we can learn All personnel undertaking safety-critical roles should adhere to the principles underlying the application of non-technical skills to ensure that they share the same mental models and have a clear understanding of what is required of themselves and others to complete tasks safely. Who may benefit Rail operators (including train controllers), rail protection officers and track maintenance personnel may all benefit from the findings in this report.",NA,Wadestown
RO-2023-104,"Passenger Train 104 (Te Huia) SPAD and potential conflict, Penrose, Auckland, 17 June 2023",17 Jun 2023,14 Nov 2024,23-104,"What happened On Saturday 17 June 2023, the Te Huia regional passenger train service named Te Huia was travelling from Hamilton to Auckland on a scheduled service. At Penrose Station on the North Auckland line, the train passed a stop signal and entered the Onehunga branch line junction , damaging the junction points. The track route and signals, which included the junction points, had been set for an Auckland One Rail commuter train (Service 6516) on the Onehunga branch line. That train was about to depart Penrose platform 3, which was located on the Onehunga branch line. The signalling system detected that Te Huia had entered the junction, and the signals on the Onehunga branch line reverted to a stop sequence, alerting the commuter train driver that the route was occupied. There were no injuries and there was no damage to the trains. However, Te Huia damaged the junction points, leading to a lengthy disruption to services. Why it happened The locomotive engineer on Te Huia incorrectly interpreted the signal for the Onehunga branch line (signal 312) as their own signal to proceed. The applicable signal (signal 308) for the line on which they were travelling was at stop but was not within their clear view. There was no effective engineering control to prevent the signal being passed at stop or mitigate the consequences of the event, meaning Te Huia entered an area of potential conflict. The locomotive engineer’s absence from operating on the North Auckland line meant they were unfamiliar with the route and the signalling system approaching Penrose Station. What we can learn Complex systems such as rail require robust engineering risk controls to guard against the outcomes associated with human performance limitations. Administrative controls are vulnerable to human error and non-compliance. They should not be solely relied on to keep a system safe. Compliance with the rail standards and the management of the risks on the railway network require monitoring to assure those using the system that the risks have been managed appropriately. Who may benefit Rail personnel, rail operators, rail access providers, transport planners and anyone involved in safety auditing and assessments may benefit from the findings in this report.","017/24, 018/24, 019/24",Penrose
