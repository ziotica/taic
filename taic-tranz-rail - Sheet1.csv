Three passengers on the train were fatally injured and seven seriously injured. The truck driver received minor injuries. [From findings and observations in the TAIC report: The truck driver had not noticed the crossing alarms before the collision, and did not see the approaching train until the collision was unavoidable. A number of factors could have contributed to the truck driver's failure to notice the crossing alarms, but the layout of the road intersection, and the need to consider conflicting traffic were probably the major influences. This accident has similar features to another accident investigated by the Commission, at Kimberley Road near Levin on 28 May, 1993. (Transport Accident Investigation Commission report 93-105). The Kimberley Road level crossing is also close to the intersection with the State Highway. There are many places throughout New Zealand where the railway runs parallel and adjacent to a major road, with the consequence that there is little room between the intersections with side roads and the level crossings. In many cases the gap between the intersection and the crossing is less than 20 metres, which is the legal maximum length of heavy truck and trailer combinations, so that such combinations must obstruct either the railway crossing or the intersection (or both) if they stop. For traffic turning from the main road towards the crossing, the distance is so short that it can be covered too quickly for some motorists to observe the crossing, react to any train approaching, and take action to avoid an accident. Report 93-112 drew attention to TAIC safety recommendations 056/93 and 057/93 made to Transit New Zealand in report 93-105.]","056/93, 057/93",Rolleston

The driver of the hi-rail vehicle saw the train and was able to off-track in time to avert a collision. On 17 January 2000, train control gave permission for a group of hi-rail vehicles to on-track near Paerata in front of a passenger express train. The train collided with one of the hi-rail vehicles and pushed it some 300 m along the track. The hi-rail vehicle, which was unoccupied at the time, was destroyed in the collision. Another 2 incidents occurred where train control gave permission for trains to enter sections of track occupied by hi-rail vehicles: one on 14 February 2000 near St Andrews, and one on 5 September 2000 near Woodville. Neither of these 2 incidents resulted in collisions. Given the similar issues arising from each incident, all 4 were combined into this one report. Safety issues identified included: the repeated non-adherence to basic train control techniques taught during training and covered by procedures in the operating code; inadequate auditing and assessment of train controller performance; train controllers not using, nor being required to use, signal ""blocking commands"" as a defence against them issuing conflicting instructions to track users; the potential for train controllers to report for duty when not fit to do so.

The safety issues identified included: the train controllers not following correct procedures for handling track user inquiries; the lack of forward planning on the train control diagrams; the train controllers’ lack of attention in ensuring the train control diagram was accurate and complete; the issuing of a track warrant into a section of track that at the time was known to be occupied; the hand-over process when the outgoing train controller completed his shift; train controllers not using, nor being required to use, signal “blocking commands” to protect maintenance gangs and hi-rail vehicles; the absence of an area familiarisation visit for the train controller prior to certification. The Commission’s previous Occurrence Reports 00-101, 00-116 and 02-118 identified similar safety issues, and safety recommendations were made to the Managing Director of Tranz Rail to address the issues.

RO-2002-129,"Train control incidents, trains authorised to enter sections of track already occupied by hi-rail vehicles and work groups, various locations, 29 August 2002 to 4 December 2002",4 Dec 2002,16 Dec 2003,02-129,"On 29 August 2002, an incident occurred at Maimai when a locomotive engineer was authorised by train control to enter a section of track already occupied by a rail contractor. The locomotive engineer saw the contractor and stopped the train short of the work site. On 21 November 2002, train control cleared a signal at Ashburton that authorised a train to enter a section of track that was already occupied by a hi-rail vehicle. Fortunately the driver of the hi-rail vehicle overheard the conversation between the train controller and the locomotive engineer and interrupted to advise that he was still in the section. The train did not enter the occupied section. On 4 December 2002, an incident occurred near Lepperton when a locomotive engineer was issued with a track warrant by train control and given a signal to proceed into a section already occupied by a track gang replacing a broken rail. A collision was averted only because the track gang had cleared the track minutes before the train arrived. Given the potential for each incident to have resulted in a collision and the similar issues arising from each incident, all 3 were combined into one report. The safety issues identified included: the train controllers not following correct procedures for handling track user inquiries; the lack of forward planning on the train control diagrams; the train controllers’ lack of attention in ensuring the train control diagram was accurate and complete; the issuing of a track warrant into a section of track that at the time was known to be occupied; the hand-over process when the outgoing train controller completed his shift; train controllers not using, nor being required to use, signal “blocking commands” to protect maintenance gangs and hi-rail vehicles; the absence of an area familiarisation visit for the train controller prior to certification.

RO-2003-101,"Express freight Train 226, person injured while stepping down from wagon, Paekakariki, 7 January 2003",7 Jan 2003,12 Mar 2004,03-101,"On Tuesday, 7 January 2003, at about 1928, a passenger who had alighted from an electric multiple unit train at Paekakariki was injured as she got down off a wagon of an express freight train. The freight train was berthed at the platform at Paekakariki and blocking access via a pedestrian crossing over the railway line to the public car park. The injured passenger was one of a number of passengers who climbed over the flat deck wagon to gain access to the car park beyond. The passenger suffered a serious ankle injury, which required hospital treatment. Had the train moved while the passengers were crossing the wagon, multiple injuries or fatalities could have resulted. The safety issues identified were the berthing of a freight train to block the pedestrian crossing during peak commuter travel time, and the unlawful actions of members of the public in crossing over the wagons to exit the platform and access the public car park. In view of the safety actions taken by the operator following the accident no safety recommendations were made",NA,Paekakariki
RO-2003-102,"Hi-rail vehicle 67425, derailment, near Fordel, 10 February 2003",10 Feb 2003,23 Jun 2004,03-102,"On Monday 10 February 2003, at about 1600, hi-rail vehicle 67425 derailed near Fordell during a special hot weather track inspection on the Marton-New Plymouth Line. The vehicle rolled and came to rest on its side, clear of the track. The driver sustained serious injuries and the vehicle was extensively damaged. As a result, about 90 minutes passed before the driver was able to use his cellphone to alert the Police, and subsequently train control, to his situation. Meanwhile, the designated time of 1615 for the hi-rail vehicle to be off track had elapsed, and the train controller authorised express freight Train 545 to enter the same section of track. The train controller was able to alert the locomotive engineer of Train 545 before he reached the accident site. The safety issues identified included: the training and certification of drivers to operate a hi-rail vehicle; the operating rules that allowed a train controller to authorise a train to enter a section of track that was already occupied; the wearing of seatbelts when operating a hi-rail vehicle on track. In view of the safety actions taken to address the track occupancy procedures, no safety recommendations have been made regarding that issue. One safety recommendation has been made to the Chief Executive of Tranz Rail regarding the wearing of seatbelts and one safety recommendation has been made to the General Manager of Transfield Services (New Zealand) Limited regarding training and certification of hi-rail vehicle drivers.","018/04, 019/04",Marton

The safety issues identified included: the training and certification of new entrant train controllers on additional train control desks soon after their initial certification; the lack of a structured process for area familiarisation prior to certification on a train control desk; the manning of the Auckland train control desk by unqualified staff; the train controller not applying adequate safety measures to protect a hi-rail vehicle movement; the train controller not using, nor being required to use, signal “blocking commands” as a defence against authorising a train to enter a section into which a hi-rail vehicle was authorised to enter. The mandatory use of signal blocking commands, previously recommended by the Commission, has now been implemented. One safety recommendation addressing the issue of supervision of train controllers in training was made to the operator.",053/03,Amokura

The curve was covered by a temporary heat restriction of 40 km/h and the train was travelling at about 85 km/h when the derailment occurred. A track buckle was triggered by the passage of the train travelling much faster than the authorised speed. The safety issues identified included: the excessive speed of the train; the train controller not recognising a fast run and advising the locomotive engineer; the effectiveness of crew resource management; a section of track left in a stressed condition for a significant period of time; the non-standard set up of the locomotive event recorder.
