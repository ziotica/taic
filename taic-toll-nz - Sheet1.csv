RO-2006-105,"Incorporated into Report 07-105",13 Jun 2006,15 Sep 2010,06-105,"Between June 2006 and April 2007 the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) launched inquiries into 5 separate platform overrun events on the Auckland suburban rail network. Because there appeared to be a number of common factors contributing to the overruns, they have been combined into this one report. All overruns involved push/pull train sets designed and modified in New Zealand from 2003 to cater for the growing needs of the Auckland transport network, pending expansion and modification of the rail infrastructure to cater for new electric train sets within 7 to 9 years. In all cases the trains were being driven by Toll Rail locomotive engineers in the push mode. There were no injuries and no damage resulting from any of the 5 incidents. In 4 of the 5 incidents the procedures for dealing with a platform overrun were followed correctly. In one of the incidents, the driver reversed his train to the platform without the required authority from train control. The driving technique of the Toll Rail locomotive engineers was a significant factor leading to the platform overruns. In particular, there was no standardised methodology taught for braking and other train-handling techniques. Trainer drivers were not taught how to teach trainee drivers and were themselves not subject to minimum levels of experience and competency before undertaking trainer duties. The Commission found that the brake system design was not ideally suited for outer-urban commuter train operations, but it was considered fit for the trains' intended purpose of outer-urban, limited-stop operations that existed in Auckland at the time. The Commission determined that the National Rail System Standard for passenger train braking distance was not relevant to the design of the network at the time, so the fact that the trains did not comply with that Standard for stopping distance was not in itself a significant safety issue. However, the fact that the trains were signed off as being compliant while they technically did not meet the Standard was a safety issue that needs addressing by the industry. The Commission has also determined that the National Rail System Standard needs to be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with good rail operating practice and is applicable to the New Zealand rail industry, and that the regulator needs to maintain a tight control over the Standard that are currently governed by the industry. This report should be read in conjunction with the Commission's previous Report 05-123, Empty passenger Train 4356, overrun of conditional stop board without authority, following an automatic air brake valve irregularity at Meadowbank on 6 October 2005. In that report the Commission commented on the design, performance and maintenance of the brake system on the push/pull fleet. Some of the findings and recommendations in Report 05-123 are equally applicable to this report. Toll Rail's interpretation of the National Rail System Standard and its decision to test the stopping performance of the push/pull sets based on single-car breakaway tests, rather than as a complete train, resulted in the Standard as written not being complied with. There was, however, an error within the Standard that had not been detected by either the operating company or the regulator until the trains had been in service for 4 years. The report makes comments on what level of regulatory oversight should be applied to the design, build and sign off for the push/pull train sets. Two recommendations have been made to the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency to address the safety issues identified in this report about the standards of driver training and compliance with the National Rail System Standard.

RO-2007-102,"(Incorporating inquiry 07-111): freight train mainline derailments, various locations on the national network, from 6 March 2007 to 1 October 2009",6 Mar 2007,21 Jun 2012,07-102,"Between March 2007 and October 2009 there were 5 derailments involving container wagons conveying single 6-metre (m) containers loaded with bulk grain, positioned on the leading ends of the wagons. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) combined the events into a single inquiry. In 2005 the Commission made a recommendation to review the current track geometry standards and the wagon maintenance standards to ensure those standards are compatible and minimise the potential for derailments caused by dynamic interaction, where the condition of the wagon and the speed at which it is travelling interact with one or more rail track faults. This can cause the wagon to oscillate and derail (see Appendix 7 for a description of dynamic interaction). For most of the period covered by these accidents the freight train operations and track maintenance and management were with different entities. Today, responsibility for both rests with KiwiRail Limited. In 2009 KiwiRail refined the way it measured and managed track faults and prioritised their repair. In 2011 it tightened wagon wheel maintenance requirements. These improvements reduced the risk of dynamic interaction-related derailments. In 2010 KiwiRail installed acoustic bearing monitoring equipment at 3 key points on the rail network to detect failing wheel bearings before they collapsed; another cause of derailments that had resulted in a Commission recommendation. Mainline derailments have about halved during KiwiRail's tenure. The Commission believes the actions taken by KiwiRail have significantly reduced the likelihood of future occurrences similar to those that led to this inquiry. The key lessons learnt from the inquiry into these occurrences were: sufficient resources need to be put into maintaining rail track infrastructure and rolling stock if mainline derailments are to be kept as low as reasonably practicable; if the allowable tolerances for the condition of rail track and rail wagons are not compatible, dynamic interaction between the track and wagons will result in an increase in mainline derailments.",NA,Glenavy

In particular, there was no standardised methodology taught for braking and other train-handling techniques. Trainer drivers were not taught how to teach trainee drivers and were themselves not subject to minimum levels of experience and competency before undertaking trainer duties. The Commission found that the brake system design was not ideally suited for outer-urban commuter train operations, but it was considered fit for the trains' intended purpose of outer-urban, limited-stop operations that existed in Auckland at the time. The Commission determined that the National Rail System Standard for passenger train braking distance was not relevant to the design of the network at the time, so the fact that the trains did not comply with that Standard for stopping distance was not in itself a significant safety issue. However, the fact that the trains were signed off as being compliant while they technically did not meet the Standard was a safety issue that needs addressing by the industry. The Commission has also determined that the National Rail System Standard needs to be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with good rail operating practice and is applicable to the New Zealand rail industry, and that the regulator needs to maintain a tight control over the Standard that are currently governed by the industry. This report should be read in conjunction with the Commission's previous Report 05-123, Empty passenger Train 4356, overrun of conditional stop board without authority, following an automatic air brake valve irregularity at Meadowbank on 6 October 2005. In that report the Commission commented on the design, performance and maintenance of the brake system on the push/pull fleet. Some of the findings and recommendations in Report 05-123 are equally applicable to this report. Toll Rail's interpretation of the National Rail System Standard and its decision to test the stopping performance of the push/pull sets based on single-car breakaway tests, rather than as a complete train, resulted in the Standard as written not being complied with. There was, however, an error within the Standard that had not been detected by either the operating company or the regulator until the trains had been in service for 4 years. The report makes comments on what level of regulatory oversight should be applied to the design, build and sign off for the push/pull train sets. Two recommendations have been made to the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency to address the safety issues identified in this report about the standards of driver training and compliance with the National Rail System Standard. Three recommendations have been made to the Secretary for Transport about the status of the National Rail System Standard. The report includes inquiries 06-105 and 06-107.","033/10, 034/10, 035/10, 031/10, 032/10",Meadowbank

The locomotive engineer did not stop on the main line at Seddon as required and obtain a new track warrant to travel beyond Seddon. Southbound Train 723 was sitting on the loop when Train 720 passed through Seddon. There were no other conflicting movements and as a result there was no damage or injury. Safety issues identified were: management of fatigue in train operations; detecting sleep disorders; locomotive engineer vigilance systems; crew resource management; monitoring of rail vehicles on non-track-circuited sections of the controlled network.

Work Train 22 was stationary and was working on the adjacent Down Main line with its cranes fouling the Up Main line. The gantry swung around and struck one of the crane operators, knocking him from the wagon and under the passing train. The operator was fatally injured. The safety issues identified included: the unfamiliarity of staff working in double-line territory; the absence of an appropriate induction for the person-in-charge and the rail recovery unit operators prior to working in double-line territory; the absence of a hazard analysis and task briefing prior to starting work on the day; the absence of any worksite protection on the adjacent main line; unclear procedures regarding the application of appropriate protection rules; the level of auditing or regulatory oversight of the safety system.

RO-2007-111,"(Incorporating inquiry 07-102): freight train mainline derailments, various locations on the national network, from 6 March 2007 to 1 October 2009",28 Jul 2007,21 Jun 2012,07-111,"Between March 2007 and October 2009 there were 5 derailments involving container wagons conveying single 6-metre (m) containers loaded with bulk grain, positioned on the leading ends of the wagons. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) combined the events into a single inquiry. In 2005 the Commission made a recommendation to review the current track geometry standards and the wagon maintenance standards to ensure those standards are compatible and minimise the potential for derailments caused by dynamic interaction, where the condition of the wagon and the speed at which it is travelling interact with one or more rail track faults. This can cause the wagon to oscillate and derail (see Appendix 7 for a description of dynamic interaction). For most of the period covered by these accidents the freight train operations and track maintenance and management were with different entities. Today, responsibility for both rests with KiwiRail Limited. In 2009 KiwiRail refined the way it measured and managed track faults and prioritised their repair. In 2011 it tightened wagon wheel maintenance requirements. These improvements reduced the risk of dynamic interaction-related derailments. In 2010 KiwiRail installed acoustic bearing monitoring equipment at 3 key points on the rail network to detect failing wheel bearings before they collapsed; another cause of derailments that had resulted in a Commission recommendation. Mainline derailments have about halved during KiwiRail's tenure. The Commission believes the actions taken by KiwiRail have significantly reduced the likelihood of future occurrences similar to those that led to this inquiry. The key lessons learnt from the inquiry into these occurrences were: sufficient resources need to be put into maintaining rail track infrastructure and rolling stock if mainline derailments are to be kept as low as reasonably practicable; if the allowable tolerances for the condition of rail track and rail wagons are not compatible, dynamic interaction between the track and wagons will result in an increase in mainline derailments.",NA,Ngaurukehu

The emergency brakes applied automatically as the air pressure in the brake pipe reduced and both portions of the train rolled to a stop, some distance apart. The locomotive engineer went back to examine the train and saw that there was no train end monitor attached to the last wagon. Thinking this was the last wagon on the train and that the loss of the train end monitor was responsible for the loss of air in the brake pipe, he advised train control and continued, leaving behind the rear 10 wagons. These wagons were found some time later by the locomotive engineer of a following train who was following at caution on instruction from train control, because the section of track was showing as occupied on the train control centralised traffic control panel. There were no injuries and no damage to the train or infrastructure. The safety issues identified included: the manual overriding of a correctly operating signalling system; failure to establish beyond reasonable doubt the cause of the brake pipe air loss; failure to ensure beyond reasonable doubt that the Te Awamutu – Te Kawa block section was unoccupied before a train was authorised to enter the block section; the poor level of training in and application of crew resource management within the rail industry; the response of train controllers to operating incidents.

RO-2007-114,"Derailment caused by a wheel-bearing failure, Huntly, 19 October 2007, and 11 subsequent wheel-bearing failures at various locations during the following 12 month period",19 Oct 2007,9 Dec 2010,07-114,"Between Friday 19 October 2007 and Sunday 5 October 2008, there were 12 occurrences when wheel-bearings failed on wagons travelling on express freight trains at various locations in the North and South Island. Seven of the 12 wheel-bearing failures resulted in the affected wagon derailing, and causing a number of following wagons to also derail. The derailments caused extensive damage to the rolling stock, freight it was conveying and the rail network. On 2 occasions, molten metal from the failed wheel-bearings resulted in fires in trackside foliage and across adjacent land. No-one was injured in any of the derailments. The Commission determined that wheel-bearings were critical items, the failure of which had the potential to result in a derailment. The derailments usually resulted in substantial damage to track and infrastructure, and have the potential to cause injury to third parties if the derailment occurs adjacent to populated areas or other infrastructure. The reason for the failures of the wheel-bearings could not be conclusively determined because the bearings had usually catastrophically failed, destroying the evidence and historically inadequate record-keeping for maintenance and service life of the bearings that could not support probable cause investigation. Because the impending failure of wheel-bearings can be difficult to detect through traditional inspection procedures, the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of the Land Transport NZ (predecessor to NZ Transport Agency) on 8 March 2008 that he address the safety issue where the New Zealand rail network had not been protected with a track-side acoustic wheel-bearing monitoring system in line with current international best practice. In the latter half of 2010, KiwiRail was completing the installation of an integrated acoustic wheel-bearing monitoring, coupled in motion weighbridge, wheel impact and automatic vehicle identification system at strategic sites on its network. The Safety Action section of the report shows a number of other initiatives that have been taken by KiwiRail since 2008, which together with the acoustic wheel-bearing monitoring system appears to have reduced the number of reported",008/08,Huntly

The derailed wagon was dragged a further 2.75 km until the leading bogie also derailed. The wagon tipped on its side, derailing the wagon immediately in front and behind it. There were no injuries. The cause of the derailment was not conclusively established, but the circumstances point to dynamic interaction between the track and the wagon, with the condition of both being at the upper limits of their working tolerances being a factor. Safety issues identified included: recurrent derailments resulting from a combination of track geometry and wagon bogie condition at or near current maintenance limits; the quality and consistency of documented standards, rules and codes relating to the handling of derailed wagons conveying liquid petroleum gas tanks; the emergency response to the derailment.

The brake calliper fell across the rail and derailed one wheel set on the train. The train was stopped, but not before the wheel set, plus another that subsequently derailed, had re-railed. The brake calliper fell because the securing key had either failed or worked loose. Damage to the train was minimal and no-one was injured. On Tuesday 3 June 2008, and again on Friday 25 July 2008, fires broke out in the area of the diesel auxiliary motors fitted on DMU passenger trains while running scheduled services at Glen Eden and Waitakere respectively. On each occasion the train was stopped and the fire extinguished by the train crews with assistance from the New Zealand Fire Service in one incident, with minimal damage to the train and no persons injured. Both fires were seated on the top of the under-slung auxiliary motors. The Commission had investigated 3 previous auxiliary motor fire incidents since 2004 and found that cleanliness was an issue in all 3 incidents because oily residue that had accumulated on top of the motors had been ignited. The cause of all 3 incidents in this report stemmed from inadequate service and maintenance practices at the Auckland passenger vehicle maintenance depot located at Westfield (the maintenance depot). The maintenance depot was not delivering a maintenance regime that was in line with sound railway engineering practices, and although the maintenance depot had to cope with more and longer trains than those for which it had originally been designed for, it might have delivered a better level of maintenance if better systems had been in place. According to the Railways Act 2005 and rail participants’ safety cases, KiwiRail was responsible for maintaining the Auckland metro trains and the operator Veolia was responsible for monitoring KiwiRail’s performance to ensure that the trains were being maintained in accordance with sound railway engineering practices. The contractual arrangements between ARTA (the owner of the trains), Veolia (the operator of the trains) and KiwiRail (the maintainer of the trains) were consistent with the Railways Act 2005 and the National Rail System Standard (NRSS). A blurring of responsibilities around the contracts and a breakdown of relationships at that time at a senior management level in all 3 entities were hampering the effective execution of those contracts. Insufficient investment had been put into expanding and improving the efficiency of the then current maintenance facility at Westfield to cope with the planned increase in passenger rolling stock. KiwiRail has taken safety actions to address the specific maintenance issues contributing to the 3 incidents, and has also made significant modifications to the maintenance depot to improve its efficiency and level of safety. ARTA and KiwiRail have also allocated some stabling and servicing of the Auckland metro trains to other facilities around Auckland to alleviate the demands placed on the maintenance depot at Westfield. In view of the safety actions taken, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the Commission) has made no new safety recommendations. Key lessons: Oily residue or other combustible material that is allowed to accumulate on or around combustion motors is a fire hazard.

High current being drawn by the short circuit caused the overhead traction lines to part and fall onto the train. The train was travelling between Paremata and Mana stations on the North Island Main Trunk, en route from Wellington to Paraparaumu, when the driver experienced problems with the traction motors. The train was a 2-car train set with one motor car and one trailer car and was being driven in the reverse direction from the trailer cab. After passenger exchange at Mana, the driver attempted to depart the platform but the train did not move. Each attempt to move the train resulted in an immediate traction motor overload. The driver was leaving the train to walk along the platform to the rear motor car when there was a brilliant flash above his head. The overhead traction lines parted and the loose ends dropped onto the train and the platform. The electrical equipment cabinet, just below the level of the platform on the motor car, was on fire. Train 6294 was evacuated and the public were cleared from the area while the potentially live overhead lines were isolated and made safe. There were no injuries and the fire was extinguished before the Fire Service arrived at the scene. The fault in the traction motor had been developing throughout the previous week, yet weaknesses in the fault-reporting system meant the developing fault went unnoticed, and frequent re-setting of the circuit breaker eventually resulted in it, together with the then-unprotected electrical line contactors, failing. With no electrical protection between the fault in the traction motor and the power supply, a very high electrical current passed between the overhead traction line and the train’s pantograph, causing the line to melt and part.","032/09, 033/09, 034/09, 035/09",Mana

RO-2008-105,"(Incorporating 09-101): express freight train derailments owing to the failure of bogie side frames, various locations on the North Island Main Trunk, between 21 June 2008 and 7 May 2009",21 Jun 2008,21 Oct 2010,08-105,"Between 21 June 2008 and 7 May 2009, 3 express freight trains derailed at various locations on the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) line. All 3 derailments were caused by the failure and collapse of bogie side frames on wagons. The side frame failures were all similar in that they started with a fatigue crack that propagated over a period of days rather than weeks, through the box section of the side frame, until the remaining material failed in overload during normal train operations. The side frame failures were also similar to previous side frame failures investigated and reported on by the Commission. The cracks started in an area that would have been difficult to detect during normal operational and maintenance wagon checks. The side frames sometimes lacked identifying marks and historically there had been no records kept of their age and maintenance history, so the operator had started a programme of magnetic particle inspections (MPIs) to detect the presence of fatigue cracking in the side frames when the bogies were brought in for overhaul. The inspection programme found over 4 years an average 60% of side frames with cracks that required repair. At the current inspection rate, all side frames will not be inspected before 2020. Until all side frames are tested for cracks and repaired, the potential for main-line derailments attributed to bogie side frame failures remains. Given the risk that main-line derailments pose to people and infrastructure, the Commission has made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency to conduct a risk assessment and if necessary require the inspection rate of side frames to be accelerated.",NA,Hihitahi
